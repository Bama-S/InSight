<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">One reason we looked at language
was to obtain a general view of the interesting and scientific way in which rules relating
to language are described in ancient Indian texts. We must appreciate that language
initially evolved through spoken language and then these grammarians tried to describe an
already existing language on the basis of scientifically designed rules. Panini, in his
work, concentrated on brevity and hence used many devices and references to achieve his
aim. Tholkappiyar on the other hand, &nbsp; was more interested in giving detailed
description and hence,&nbsp; many of his rules are very long.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">An interesting offshoot of studying
language theory has been the thought of adopting these scientific rules to make computers
understand language. The scientifically designed rules are easily adaptable to computing
and hence can form a basis for understanding and generation of these languages.</font></p>
