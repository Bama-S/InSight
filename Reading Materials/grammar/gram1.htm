<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">Folks, imagine yourself in some
Lingualand where the Lingua language that's spoken doesn't have a well-defined grammar.
Say, a particular sentence means different things to different people. Mind you, the
individual words in the sentence do not have varying meanings. It's just the difference in
the interpretation of the grouping of the words. Obviously, that's unimaginable!</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">Now the question is how do you
think we humans manage to communicate with each other through speech or writing? On a bit
of thinking it must become clear to you that it's because of the conventions that we
adhere to, that we are able to communicate. These conventions vary from culture to culture
and language to language. These conventions are formalized as rules which again vary from
language to language. In our early years we learn language primarily by listening to and
observing people around us 'communicate'! And then more formally we were taught these
conventions as Grammar in school. So what's Grammar?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">Grammar is a category of rules that
any language follows. It is something that standardizes the way we communicate. We'll
start by looking&nbsp; at the English language and then move on to Indian languages. In
Indian languages, some of the well known works that formalize these language are in fact
considered classics. We will be looking at the rules of Sanskrit language through
PaaNini's work and those of Tamil language through <em>Tholkaappiyam.</em> This we'll do
later and also make comparisons between the nature of English, Hindi and Tamil languages
so as to understand these rules or conventions better. </font></p>
