<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#008000" size="4"><strong><em>Word ordering in
English </em></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">As we have already mentioned,
grammar is a category of rules. Try to remember the English grammar that you studied in
Wren and Martin. Basically, grammar is about the ordering of words in a sentence. In
English, the word order is very critical and hence, this category of rules is very
important.<br>
Now let's look at an example in English. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3" color="#000000"><strong><em>The man
      ate the mango in the plate. </em></strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">In this sentence 'The man' is the
noun phrase, where 'man' is the noun and 'ate the mango in the plate' is the verb phrase
where 'ate' is the verb. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">Generally, a sentence consists of a
noun-phrase and a verb phrase.The noun phrase in turn consists of a determiner, followed
by zero or more adjectives, followed by a noun. The noun phrase can also be a noun phrase
followed by a prepositional phrase, as in &quot;The man with a coat&quot;, where
&quot;with a coat&quot; is a prepositional phrase having &quot;with&quot; as a preposition
followed by a noun-phrase. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">The verb phrase can be a verb
followed by a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#800000">The rules we have defined above are
only a sample. We also have special rules for passive and interrogative sentences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#008000" size="2"><strong><u>IMPORTANCE OF THE ORDER
OF PHRASES</u></strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#800000">English is very strict about
the order of the various phrases.&nbsp; This means that if we change the order of the
phrase the meaning of sentence changes. Following example illustrates this clearly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font
face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">The big man ate the cake in the dish.</font></em></strong></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#800000">If the order is changed like this,</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The cake ate the big man in the dish.</em></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#800000">you see how the meaning of the sentence
changes.</font></p>
