<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As the above examples shows, we can multiply any two
numbers, which are nearer to any power of 10 easily. This method can be further extended.
Consider 39 x 38. These two numbers are not near to any power of 10. But they are nearer
to 40. So they can be multiplied as follows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1.We choose 40, a multiple of a power of 10 as the base.e<br>
2.Write the two numbers on the left hand side.<br>
3.Subtract the numbers from 40 and write them on the rigth hand side. While subtracting
write the difference as a single digit (-1 and not -01), because the actual base is 10.<br>
4.Multiply the numbers on the right hand side and write the R.H.S of the product<br>
5.Add the numbers on the left hand side and subtract 40 from the sum to get the L.H.S of
the result.<br>
6.Since our base is 4 times the actual base(10), multiply the L.H.S value of the result by
4.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Elephant">This looks as follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since our base (40) is 4 times 10, we multiply the digits
other than the last digit (37) by 4. Hence the result is (37x4) | 2 = 158 | 2. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Similarly we can have cases where the base we choose is a
fraction of the powers of 10. Consider 48 x 51. Both are close to 50, which is half of
100. The calculations are similar to the case where the base is a multiple of a power of
10. But at the last step, we've to divide the result by 2.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">48&nbsp; -02<br>
<u>51&nbsp;&nbsp; +01 </u><br>
49&nbsp; (-02)</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
Since the base we've chosen is half of 100, we've to divide the leading digits by 2.Hence
we get (49/2) | (-02) = 24½ | (-02) = 24 | (50 + (-02)) = 24 | 48. Thus the result is 2448. The 50 is added to -02 because of the ½. ½ is considered as 0.50 and because it occurs in the hundreds place, it is taken as 50.</font></p>
