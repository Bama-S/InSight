<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can the partial dividend become negative? Why not? At any
stage the partial dividend is obtained by prefixing the previous remainder to the next
digit, and subtracting a product from that. Hence if that product is large, you can get a
negative partial dividend. What do we do in such a situation? With a little common sense,
we can find the reason for a negative partial dividend. The reason is that, our previous
'guess' of the quotient digit is more than the digit that should be actually present at
that position.&nbsp; Thus we've to reduce the guess. First we subtract 1 from our previous
guess, and see if the next partial dividend is negative. If it is so, we repeat the
process till we get a positive value for the partial dividend. Enough of theory. Let's
face it in a problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider dividing&nbsp; 50443&nbsp; by 73</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the next step we prefix 1 to 4 and subtract 21 from it to
obtain the partial dividend. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now comes the problem. Our partial dividend is -7. So we go
back to the previous step. In that step, the partial dividend was 50. We had 7 as the
quotient. Decrease the quotient by 1. By doing this, the remainder is increased to 8. This
increases the next partial dividend.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; We can now proceed further without any hitch. The
next two steps are</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;<br>
Since we've obtained 3 digits as the quotient, the next partial dividend is nothing but
the remainder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</font><img src="Examples/ex206.gif" width="281"
height="121" alt="ex206.gif (2379 bytes)"></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thus the quotient is 691 and the remainder is 0.</font></p>

<p><a href="urdhva5.htm" name="example"><font face="Comic Sans MS">See another example</font></a></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We see that by going back one step we are in fact correcting
the previous value of the partial dividend. How much is this correction that is applied,
when we 'go back'? Let d1 be the first digit of the divisor (the one with which we
actually divide, in the Straight Division method) and d2 be the second digit of the
divisor. Let 'q' be the quotient digit, which is reduced on going back. Decreasing 'q' by
1 results in an increase in the remainder 'r' by 'd1'. We prefix this new remainder (r +
d1) to the next digit , and subtract the product of d2 and the new value of q. This new q
is 1 less than the old q.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thus the effective increase in partial dividend is 10 x d1 +
1 xd2&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't this method be applied to divisors of more than 2
digits? How many steps have we to go back to correct the partial dividend? <a
