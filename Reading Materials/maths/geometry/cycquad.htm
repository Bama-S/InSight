    They can be inscribed in a circle. In the figure shown,<br>

<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#004000"><strong>Brahmagupta obtained a formula for
the area of the cyclic quadrilateral in terms of its sides. He also found expressions for
its diagonals. Brahmagupta's theorem about the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral was
rediscovered by W.Snell in 1619 A.D.<br>
<br>
The area of a cyclic quadrilateral is given in terms of its sides by:<br>
area = sqrt((Q - a<sub>1</sub>)(Q - a<sub>2</sub>)(Q - a<sub>3</sub>)(Q - a<sub>4</sub>))<br>
where 2Q = a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>+ a<sub>3</sub> + a<sub>4</sub> and a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>,a<sub>4</sub>
are the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral.<br>
<br>
The formula for area of the triangle in terms of its sides was given by Heron of
Alexandria. Brahmagupta's work on cyclic quadrilaterals is a special case of Heron's
theorem. His mode of derivation of the theorem is entirely different from that of Heron.<br>
