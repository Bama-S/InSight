    other such objects used for construction. Geometry was highly developed in ancient India,

<p><font face="Calisto MT">The meticulous prescriptions for these constructions &nbsp;
reveals a precise knowledge of several theorems of Geometry. We propose an intoduction to
some of these in the discussions to follow.It includes theorems dealing with the
properties of triangles and cyclic quadrilaterals.<br>
<br>
There are several sutras or rules used in geometry, mainly those used in construction.
These sutras were called 'sulbasutra'. The root word 'sulb' or 'sulv' means to measure and
'sulba' means measuring rope or cord.The katyayana Sulbasutras belong to the Sukla
Yajurveda, and the remaining Sulbasutras to Krsna Yajurveda.The oldest Sulbasutras, the
Bodhayana is said to be composed in 8th century B.C.</font></p>
