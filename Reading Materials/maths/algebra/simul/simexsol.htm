  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>7x - 3y = 8<br>
    5x + 9y = 28</strong><br>
    Numerator for x, Nx = (-3 × 28) - (9 × 8) = -84 -72 = -156<br>
    Numerator for y, Ny = (5 × 8) - (7 × 28) = 40 - 196 = -156<br>
    Denominator for x &amp; y, Dxy = ( 5 × -3 ) - ( 7 × 9) = -15 - 63 = -78<br>
    <br>
    x = Nx / Dxy = -156 / -78 = 2<br>
    y = Ny / Dxy = -156 / -78 = 2.<br>
    <br>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">A father has 5 sons. The sum of the ages of the 5 sons equals
    the age of the father. In 12 years time the sum of the ages of the sons will be double
    that of their father. What is the father's age now ? <br>
    Let the present age of the father be 'x' years. <br>
    Let the sum of the present ages of the 5 sons be 'y' years.<br>
    <br>
    Currently, the age of the father is given to be equal to the sum of his sons' ages. <br>
    Hence, we have x = y (or) <strong>x - y = 0.</strong><br>
    <br>
    12 years later, the sums of the sons' ages is given to be double the father's age.<br>
    So, we have (y + (5 × 12)) = 2 (x + 12)<br>
    y + 60 = 2x + 24<br>
    <strong>2x - y = 36<br>
    </strong><br>
    The two equations that we get are<br>
    x - y = 0<br>
    2x - y = 36<br>
    <br>
    Nx = ( ( -1) × 36) - ( ( -1) × 0) = - 36<br>
    Ny = ( 2 × 0) - (1 × 36) = - 36<br>
    Dxy = ( 2 × ( -1)) - (1 × ( -1)) = - 2 + 1 = (- 1)<br>
    <br>
    x = Nx / Dxy = -36 / -1 = 36.<br>
    Thus, the present age of the father is<strong> 36 years.<br>
    </strong><br>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our examination is for a total of N marks, out which one
    portion is for a project and the rest is for an assignment. I scored 70% on the project
    and 60% on the assignment, while my friend's scores were just the opposite. Our total
    individual scores were 40 and 38 respectively. For how many marks was the examination ? <br>
    Let p be the number of marks for the project &amp; q be the number of marks for the
    assignment.<br>
    Then, p + q = N, the total number of marks.<br>
    <br>
    My marks were 0.7p + 0.6q = 40<br>
    My friend's marks were 0.6p + 0.7q = 38<strong><br>
    <br>
    </strong>This is of special type 2. So, just adding &amp; subtracting the equations will
    yield the results.<br>
    Adding the two equations, we get<br>
    <br>
    1.3p + 1.3q = 78<br>
    <br>
    Dividing by 1.3, we get p + q = N = 60.<br>

  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consider the equations -<br>
    124x + 32y = 214<br>
    31x + 8y = 69<br>
    What is special about these equations ? <br>
    <br>
    Here, 124 / 31 = 32 / 8 but is not equal to 214 / 69.<br>
    There is no solution to these equations. These lines are parallel lines in the coordinate
    plane. As parallel lines meet only at infinity, there are no common points between the two
    lines. </font></li>
