simultaneous equations ?</strong></font></u></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Your mom's baking cakes for you. She
carefully weighs flour and sugar and mixes them in an appropriate ratio. She uses two
different cups to measure them out. On one day, she finds that when she mixes 2 cups of
flour and 1 cup of sugar, she gets 1½ kg of cake. On another day, she mixes 3 cups of
flour and 2 cups of sugar and gets 2½ kg of cake. Now, she wants to find the measure of
each cup.<br>
So, how do you think she found out ?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Well, all she had to do was to form a
pair of simultaneous equations and solve them ! See if you can solve it . Check your
solution <a href="simsol1.htm">here</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">More mathematically, simultaneous equations are a
set of 'n' equations in 'n' variables.&nbsp; The aim is to solve for the n variables. For
example, consider the two equations.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><strong>2x + 3y =
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- eqn A<br>
</strong><align="center"><strong>4x + 5y = 14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- eqn B</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">In the above case, we wish to solve
for x &amp; y, which are the two unknowns.</font></p>
