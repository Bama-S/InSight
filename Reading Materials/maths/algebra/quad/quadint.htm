without looking at her watch?</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Garamond" size="4">It's simple ! She just has to form a
quadratic equation &amp; find out the time she had been driving.</font></p>

if your answer matches with Priya's, </font><font color="#00FF00"><a style="color: rgb(0,255,128)" href="quadsol1.htm">here</a></font><font color="#FFFF80">

<p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Garamond" size="4">Mathematically speaking, quadratic
equations are equations of the second degree. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Garamond" size="4">For example, ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0
is a quadratic equation. The solution to such an equation will yield two values for the
unknown quantity x.</font></p>
