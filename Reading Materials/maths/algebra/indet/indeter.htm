Let us try to solve this mathematically:<br>
Let 'x' be the number of tomatoes and 'y' be the number of carrots we can buy with
Rs.100/-.<br>
Therefore , we have,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 8x + 5y = 100</strong><br>
<br>
This equations looks familiar, doesn't it ? Well, it can be directly derived from the
Chinese Remainder theorem. <br>
<br>
We have one equation and two unknown quantities. If the number of unknown quantities is
greater than the number of equations , there will be an unlimited number of solutions :
these equations are called <strong>Indeterminate Equations</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where was the need to solve indeterminate equations ?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Indian mathematicians came across these equations while
solving problems in astronomy. The following was one of the problems that cropped up : - <br>
</font><font face="Comic Sans MS">The mean (position) of the sun (for sunrise) on a
Wednesday is stated to be 8 signs, 25 degrees, 36 minutes and 10 seconds. Say exactly
after how much time (since the beginning of Kaliyuga) will the Sun again assume the same
position (at sunrise) on a Thursday, a Friday, and a Wednesday.</font><font face="Century Schoolbook"><br>
A method&nbsp; called '<em><strong>kuttaka</strong></em>', was devised&nbsp; by
mathematicians like Aryabhatta and Bhaskara, to solve such indeterminate equations. </font></p>
