<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">You must be wondering where
the Chinese Remainder Theorem comes into the picture, when we're discussing Indian maths.
Well, it is similar to the indeterminate equations that Indian mathematicians like
Aryabhatta and Bhaskara attempted to solve. </font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">Suppose you have a number N.
And you have a set of integers (a1, a2, a3,....., an).&nbsp; N, when divided by each of
these integers leaves a remainder. The idea is to find N, using this relationship.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">Confused ? Maybe, this example
will clear things up.</font></p>

    <td width="84%"><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">You have X
    marbles. When you put them in groups of 8, you have 4 left and when you put them in groups
    of 6, you have 2&nbsp; left. So, the idea is to find X, which is the total number of
    marbles you have.</font></td>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">Since, X, when divided by 8
leaves a remainder of 4, we can say that (X - 4) is divisible by 8.<br>
Similarly, (X - 2) is divisible by 6.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">So, what does the theorem
state ?</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">The theorem states that a
solution to the problem exists only when the difference between the remainders is
divisible by the GCD of the divisors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">So, for the example stated
above, (4 - 2) is divisible by GCD of 8 &amp; 6 i.e. (4 -2) =2 is divisible by 2. So, a
solution exists for the example we have stated above.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000"><strong>X = 6t + 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- eqn A</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000"><strong>X = 8s + 4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- eqn B</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">where t &amp; s are integers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">From A &amp; B, we get <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6t + 2 = 8s + 4 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6t + 2 - 4 = 8s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6t - 2 = 8s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">This means that 6t -2 is
divisible by 8. &nbsp; Intuitively, we know that the minimum value of t for which this is
true is t = 3. This can be proved, using Modulo arithmetic. For now, this intuitive
understanding will suffice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size="3" color="#000000">Substituting this value for X,
we have X = 6 * 3 + 2 = 20.&nbsp; So, the total number of marbles you had was 20. Neat,
huh ? <br>
<br>
The most important result of the Chinese remainder theorem is Modulo arithmetic. So, what
is modulo arithmetic all about ? Take a peek at it <a href="modulo.htm">here.</a></font></p>
