<p><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#006633"><strong>Aryabhatta's&nbsp; Kuttaka
method :</strong></font></u></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">The word 'kuttaka' means pulveriser(which means&nbsp;
reducer). This method was developed by Aryabhatta in the 5th century to solve
indeterminate equations of the form <strong>ax - by = c.</strong></font></p>

<p><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#006F37"><strong>Meaning of the equation : </strong></font></u></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">It is required to determine an integer N which when
divided by 'a'&nbsp; leaves a remainder r<sub>1</sub> and when divided by 'b' leaves a
remainder r<sub>2</sub>. (the premise for the chinese remainder theorem !)<br>
<br>
From this we get :&nbsp; <br>
N = xa + r<sub>1</sub><br>
N = yb + r<sub>2</sub>. <br>
By equating the first equation with the second we get xa + r<sub>1</sub> = yb + r<sub>2</sub>
or ax - by = c for c = r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#006834"><strong><u>The&nbsp; method :</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Aryabhata noted that any factor common to a and b
should be a factor of c (This is what the chinese remainder theorem states ! Amazing how
people can think the same way !), otherwise the equation has no solution. Dividing a, b
and c by the greatest common factor of (a,b) we can reduce the equation to the form where
a and b&nbsp; have no common factor except for 1.<br>
<br>
Consider the example : <br>
<strong>137x + 10 = 60y</strong><br>
Express the larger of the coefficients(in this case 137 &gt; 60, so choose 137) as product
of<br>
the smaller coefficient( i.e 60). Continue doing this, now taking 60 as the larger
coefficient and so on. Hence, we get Table 1.</font></p>

</table>
</center></div>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">From this we can form the column of quotients (Column Q
of Table 1) and the column of remainders (Column R of Table 1). <br>
<strong>The number of quotients (except the first one of column Q) is odd.</strong> <br>
Now, we have to find a number called the multiplier (call it z) such that <br>
<strong>z * LR - 10 =&nbsp; LBR * m<br>
</strong>Here, 10 is the constant in the equation to be solved (<strong>137x+10=60y</strong>)
and m is any integer.<br>
Thus, we get, <strong>z * 1 - 10 = 8 * m</strong>.<br>
We have 18 * 1 - 10 = 8 * 1 . The 1 on the right hand side is the quotient. <br>
Thus, we have <strong>z = 18</strong> and <strong>m = 1</strong> for the equation<strong>
137x + 10 = 60y</strong>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook"><strong>In the above case, 10 is subtracted because the
number of quotients is odd. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">If the number quotients is even, the constant of the
equation has to be added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Now, a table has to be formed and the solution can be
read off from it.<br>
