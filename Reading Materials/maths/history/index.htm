    <td width="100%"><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">In ancient India, mathematics
    or 'Ganita' was the 'Science of Calculations'. It was primarily studied in the context of
    numerical computation and geometric measurement. Most of the Indian mathematical work can
    be found as a part of 'Jyotisha' or Astronomy. This is because Astronomy, which dealt with
    the measurement of time using the heavenly bodies, involved high levels of sophisticated
    numerical computation. Mathematics in ancient India was so well developed that the body of
    knowledge was not restricted only to the elite scholars. It was prevalently used even by
    the common people in their daily activities and profession.</font><p><font
    face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">The history of Indian mathematics dates back to the
    vedic period (around 1500 B.C.) The 'Sulbasutras' of this vedic age are texts on rules for
    altar construction. They are the oldest texts on Indian mathematics. They contain the
    general enunciation of the Pythagoras theorem,&nbsp; approximate value for square root of
    2, methods of transforming one figure to another etc... Indians also used the decimal
    place-value system of representing the numbers. They had a representation for zero. The
    origin of the decimal place-value system in India was sometime around 1st century B.C. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">There are numerous great mathematicians who
    have contributed to Indian Mathematics. The subject is a synergistic effort of all of
    them. Since even a mention of all of them would run into pages, we are able to list the
    contributions of only a few of the mathematicians. The set that we have described below is
    only a drop in the ocean of great mathematicians who lived in India.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><u>Aryabhatta</u></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">Aryabhatta was a 5th century mathematician
    and astronomer who worked&nbsp; in the following areas- the methods of determining square
    and cube roots, geometrical problems, the progression, problems involving quadratic
    equations and indeterminate equations of the first degree. The method of solving these
    equations has been called Kuttaka by later mathematicians. He was the first astronomer to
    mention that the diurnal motion of the heavens is due to the rotation of the earth about
    its axis. Other contributions Aryabhatta made towards pure mathematics were his sine
    tables, his approximation of pi and the expressions that he gave for the sum of squares
    and the sum of cubes. All his work is documented in the Aryabhatiya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="4" color="#800080"><u><strong>Brahmagupta</strong></u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">Brahmagupta was a 6th century mathematician
    and astronomer. He is believed to be the inventor of the concept of zero. He designed a
    method for solving equations of the type Nx<sup>2</sup> + 1 = My<sup>2</sup>. These type
    of equations are known as 'Varga Prakriti'. He also gave rules to solve simple quadratic
    equations. The first to use algebra in astronomy, all his work is documented in the
    'Brahma Sputa Siddhanta'. It was through this work that the Arabs first heard of
    astronomy. His contributions to astronomy include calculations for the motions of various
    planets, the rising and setting of the sun and the moon and, solar and lunar eclipses.
    Brahmagupta was one of the very few early Indian mathematicians, who conceptualised the
    earth as round, and not as flat and hollow. </font></p>

        <td width="49%"><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">Bhaskara was a 12th century
        mathematician and astronomer. He was the head of the Ujjain observatory. His work was
        mainly in algebra. He was influenced by Aryabhatta's work on Kuttaka and made his own
        modifications in order to solve indeterminate equations of the second degree. (example :
        Nx<sup>2</sup> + 1 = My<sup>2</sup> ).&nbsp; This is known as the <i>chakravala</i>
        process. Bhaskara wrote the 'Siddhanta Siromani', which has 4 parts to it - Lilavati
        (arithmetic), Bijaganita (algebra), Grahaganita (maths of the planets) and Goladhyaya
        (chapter on the celestial globe). In the Bijaganita, a rough explanation of the concept of
        infinity occurs, in terms of the fact that any number divided by 0, gives infinity. <br>

    <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">He had clear ideas of differential calculus.
    In the Goladhyaya, he gave the value of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
    diameter. The picture shown above, is claimed to be from the Bijaganita.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4">There are a lot of other mathematicians who
    have contributed to the world of Indian mathematics. Now, go on and do some research to
    find out about some of them.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
