<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">6. <b>The Holmes Murder Mystery!</b>:<br>
  Watson goes to the Syndicate Bank, leaving his apartment at 8:35 a.m. On his 
  way to the bank, he keeps a count of the number of breaths he takes. The count 
  stands at 14560 when he reaches the main entrance of the bank. There he assumes 
  his familiar role. He waits for 5 minutes when he spots Mr.Bad. He observes 
  that Mr.Bad is a well-dressed middle-aged gentleman, perhaps in his early 40s. 
  All the while, Watson also observes Mr.Bad's eyelids ( an age-old technique 
  used by detectives world-wide! ).He counts that Mr.Bad winks 3450 times continuously 
  ( a queer man indeed!) before he finally makes his move. And two minutes later, 
  Watson hears gun-shots from inside the bank and Mr.Bad barges out almost immediately. 
  And all this while, poor Watson waits outside not knowing what to do. He goes 
  and informs Holmes all that he'd observed and how helpless he was. Enter Inspector 
  Lestrade! He asks Watson the time when he heard the gun-shots. Watson blinks 
  twice ! Holmes knows it already. Do you? What's the correct time <font face="Comic Sans MS">?</font></font></p>
