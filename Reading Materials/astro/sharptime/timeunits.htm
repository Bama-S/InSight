<title>Units of time</title>

<p>The system that's presently followed to subdivide a day is of
course :<br>
1 day = 24 hours<br>
1 hour = 60 minutes<br>
1 minute = 60 seconds.<br>
<br>
However, according to the Indian system, a day is divided into 60
<em>ghati</em>s or <em>ghatika</em>s or <em>nadi</em>s. Two <em>ghati</em>s
make a <em>muhurta</em>. Equivalently, a <em>muhurta</em> is
1/30th of a day or 48 minutes. The following equations should
give one a clear understanding of the Indian system.<br>
1 day = 60 <em>ghati</em>s<br>
1 <em>ghati</em> = 60 <em>vighati</em>s or <em>pala</em>s<br>
1 <em>pala</em> = 60 <em>vipala</em>s<br>
1 <em>asu</em> or <em>prana</em> = 10 <em>vipala</em>s = 1/6th <em>pala</em>
<br>
1 <em>nimesha</em> = 1/45th <em>prana .<br>
</em></p>

<p>This system, is of course not based on some crazy person's
whim. Its got quite a bit of sanity in it! Tell you what. The
units are pretty much related to certain aspects of human
physiology. The unit <em><strong>asu</strong></em> is supposed to
be the time a normal person takes to complete one full cycle of
inhalation and exhalation. And the unit <em><strong>nimesha</strong></em>
is believed to be the average time taken for a wink of the eye! </p>

<p>As an exercise you may calculate the time ( in minutes/seconds ) that it would 
  take for a cycle of inhalation and exhalation, the time taken for a wink. <a href="exercise.htm">For
