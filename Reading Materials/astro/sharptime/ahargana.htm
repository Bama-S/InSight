<P>In Sanskrit 'ahoratra' means one full day  and 'gana' means count. 
  Hence, the Ahargana on any given day stands for the number of lunar days that 
  have elapsed starting from an epoch. As we have seen before, an 'epoch' is the 
  starting point of an era.</P>
<P>How to go about to calculate the Ahargana on a particular day? In Indian astronomy 
  the problem of finding the ahargana is posed as follows: Starting from the epoch 
  given, one has to find out the number of days that have elapsed till some date 
  specified by its  year, chaandra maasa and tithi. How'll you find it? The 
  following diagram will help you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B> 
<P>Procedure for calculating Ahargana:</P>
</B> 
<P>A|-------------------------------------------B|--------------C|----D| </P>
<P>Here, the time interval AB = X, BC = Y and CD = Z </P>
<P>where, </P>
<P>A - Beginning of epoch</P>
<P>B - Beginning of the current year</P>
<P>C - Beginning of the current Month</P>
<P>D - Beginning of the day for which Ahargana is to be calculated </P>
<P>X - No. of luni-solar years elapsed</P>
<P>Y - No. of lunar months elapsed </P>
<P>Z - No. of tithis elapsed. </P>
<P>From the  figure, we can easily calculate the number of days elapsed, but watch 
  out for a tricky one out there. As we have already seen, the Adhika maasa may 
  be defined roughly as a lunar month in which two Amavasyas occur. So, the significant 
  (though subtle) point we have to take care of here is the number of Adhika maasas 
  (say X1), in X years. Why should we do this? This is because we cannot be sure that all the X years would 
  have had only 12 lunar months. It may lead to a miscalculation for we are dealing 
  with the number of lunar days elapsed. To calculate the number of Adhika maasas, 
  we take the number of Adhika maasas in a Mahayuga as the reference. The calculations 
  are shown below:</P>
<P>Number of Adhika maasas in a Mahayuga = Number of lunar months - Number of 
  solar months.</P>
<P>Therefore, the number of Adhika maasas in X years is,</P>
<P>X1 = (Number of Adhika maasas in a Mahayuga * X) / Number of solar years in 
  a Mahayuga.</P>
<P>{ Note that there are 4320000 solar years in a Mahayuga.}</P>
<P>Having done this, we can easily calculate the number of days elapsed = [ ( 
  12 x + x1 + y + z/30)*29.530589] </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"> 
<P>In the above formula, we have converted X and Z into lunar months units by 
  multiplying by 12 and dividing by 30 respectively. We have also used the empirical 
  value of the number of days in lunar month as 29.530589.</P>
<P>Because of the non-uniform motion of the moon, the number of days elapsed (calculated 
  as above) may not be consistent with the actual value of Ahargana. So, we add 
  or subtract 1 (or leave it as it is), depending on the coincidence of the actual 
  day and the day calculated, to get the Ahargana. Dividing the answer obtained 
  by 7 and checking the remainder obtained does this crosscheck. The first day 
  of the epoch corresponds to the remainder 0 and so on. For instance, Kaliyuga 
  started on a Friday. Then for correct calculation, R=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 shall correspond 
  to Friday, Saturday,..., Thursday.</P>
<I> 
<P>The importance of Ahargana</P>
</I> 
<P>What can one do by knowing the Ahargana on a particular day? This may be the 
  question ringing in your mind. We'll answer this question now.
  Suppose we know the position of the Sun, the Moon and the planets at some epoch. We 
  also know the rate at which these celestial objects move in the stellar background 
  in the celestial sphere. If these celestial objects moved uniformly, then their 
  positions can be found at any instant of time if we know the exact time-interval 
  between the epoch and the given instant. (Actually, the rate of motion is not 
  a constant. But at this stage, it suffices if we know that 'Ahargana' helps 
  us to find the position of the celestial objects).</P>
