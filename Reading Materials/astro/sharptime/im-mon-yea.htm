<FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><P>We've seen the way to measure smaller units of time. Now we'll try to make use of some natural phenomena to observe larger units of time like years, months etc. The one phenomena whose periodicity (the interval with which it occurs) is large, is the Sun's motion along the ecliptic. Let's recollect that the ecliptic is the path traced by the sun as observed from the earth, due to the Earth's revolution around the Sun. Now, it is impossible to determine the position of Sun in the ecliptic without a reference point. This is illustrated by the following example.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Say you are in a train standing in platform and that if you look through the window you could see only another train standing in the adjacent track. When any of the train moves, you cannot come to a conclusion whether your train or the adjacent one is moving. Only by having a look at the ground you could come to a conclusion.</font></P><P>
<FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><I>Thus you can determine the position of any object only with respect to some other object</i>. To determine the position of the Sun in the ecliptic, you should have some reference object. This reference object should be fixed when you see from the earth. Stars other than the sun are at a very very large distance from the earth. So we will have these </font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">stars as our fixed frame of reference</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> and say that the sun moves in the <I>background of these stars</I>. </font></P>
<FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
<P>All the stars are at an infinite distance. But we don't include all these stars 
  in our fixed reference frame. For the sake of simplicity, we limit ourselves 
  by choosing a handful of stars as our reference. The stars we're choosing belong 
  to a group of 12 constellations called <B><I>Zodiac</i></B>. The stars of the 
  Zodiac are very near to the ecliptic.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"></FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Now, it's time to define our larger units of time. The time taken by the sun to move around the earth in this ecliptic path once is defined as a </font><B><I><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">solar year</font></i></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">, which is equal to <I>365.25</I> days. (i.e. in one solar year the Sun goes around the zodiac once). In other words, if the Sun is very close to a star in the Zodiac, it will come again to the same position in about 365.25 days.</font></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">We've seen about days and years. Let's go 
  to some thing in-between. 365 days is a longer unit of time. Let us reduce this 
  by a factor of 12. How do we define our new unit? We shall divide zodiac into 
  </font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#800000">twelve equal zones</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
  each 360</font><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">/12 
  = 30</font><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
  wide. Each zone is associated with a <B><I>zodiacal constellation</i></B>. You 
  can see the names and shapes of these constellations in the following figure. 
  </font></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/rasi.gif" WIDTH=576 HEIGHT=432></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">A keen reader would have readily observed 
  that these </font><I><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" SIZE=4>zodiacal constellations 
  do not have the same width or  an even spacing</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">!</font></I><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
  In other words, some constellations of Zodiac may entirely lie within a zone 
  of 30</font><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
  while some of them may extend beyond a zone. Why is it like that? The stars 
  are randomly distributed in the universe. We try to group them so that we can 
  form an observable pattern, which is easily recognizable. So you cannot except 
  them to be of even width and even spacing.</font></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">As a result, the twelve equal zones do not exactly correspond with these constellations</font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">.<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Even though a constellation may extend beyond 
  a single zone, each of the zones will be prominently occupied by a single constellation. 
  Based on this constellation, each of these zones is assigned a ‘</font><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">rasi</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">’ 
  or a ‘sign of the zodiac’. The sequence of rasis enumerated above is from west 
  to east. Now, digest these facts. If we divide the ecliptic into twelve zones, you 
  can start from <a name="smonths"></a>any point. But genearlly, people follow 
  some convention. In the Indian system, the beginning point of the first zone 
  is a fixed point on the ecliptic, which is opposite the star Chitra in the Kanya 
  rasi (179</font><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
  59’ away from Chitra). In the Western system, the beginning point of the zodiacal 
  division is known as the first point of Aries which corresponds to the vernal 
  equinox, where the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator. Hence there is 
  a difference between starting point of each zone. The beginning point of the 
  Mesha rasi (in Indian convention) is nearly 23</font><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">45’ 
  east of the first point of Aries (Western convention).</font></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Based on the Rasis, we define </font><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">Solar 
  month</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> as the time taken by the sun 
  to cover one rasi. Click here to view the </FONT><A HREF="Smonths.htm"><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">nam</FONT></A><A HREF="Smonths.htm"><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">es

You should have heard about Makara </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">sankranti</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">. Solar sankranti is said to occur when the sun is at the beginning point of a rasi. So, when the sun is at the beginning point of Mesha rasi, it is Mesha sankranti (which is also the beginning of the new solar year in India, and occurs around April 14/15); it is Makara sankranti when the sun has completed its stay in the Dhanur rasi and is at the beginning point of the Makara rasi (which occurs around January 14<SUP>th </SUP>). </font></P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">
<P>There is a slight problem with the solar months. The solar months are not of equal durations. Why does this happen?<BR>
This is because, the motion of the sun in the ecliptic is non-uniform (i.e. the Sun takes unequal time to travel different zones.</P>
</FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><a name="amavasaya"></a>So far we were using 
  positions of the sun to define various units. Similarly, we can use the </font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#800000">position 
  of the Moon to define various units</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">. Let 
  us see how the moon can be used to define units of time and try to correlate time 
  units based on the solar and the lunar systems. While the Sun takes 365.25 days to go around 
  the zodiac, the moon takes <B>27.32166 days</B>. This time period is known as the </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">sidereal 
  period of the moon</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">. Another periodic 
  event with respect to the moon is the time when the Sun and the moon are along the 
  same direction. This, as we've already seen, corresponds to Amavasya. The time 
  between two consecutive Amavasyas is <B>29.530588 days</B>. This value is closer 
  to a Solar month than the Sidereal period of the moon. Hence we take this value 
  as a <STRONG>Lunar Month or Chandra Maasa. </STRONG>This value of 29.530588 
  days can be arrived at as follows: The sun travels at nearly 0.99<SUP>o</SUP> 
  per day along the ecliptic whereas the moon travels at the rate of 13.17<SUP>o</SUP> 
  per day. Hence the moon overtakes the sun by 12.18<SUP>o</SUP> in one day&nbsp; 
  24.36<SUP>o</SUP> in two days and so on. Thus after 360/12.8 days (nearly 29 
  1/2&nbsp; days) the difference between the Sun and the Moon would have been 360<SUP>o</SUP>, 
  and so the Sun and the Moon would be again in the same direction as seen from the 
  earth to give the next Amavasya. At Amavasya, the sun and the moon are said 
  to be </FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">in</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> 
  </FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">conjunction. To put 
  it in a different way,&nbsp; Amavasya repeats in 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes.&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Using the Lunar months, we can define a&nbsp; </font><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">lunar year</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> as the duration of 12 lunar months. This value comes to <B>354.3670 days</B>.</font></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><a name="naksh"></a>Like rasi division in 
  the solar system, here we have the <B>nakshatra division</B>. But there we chose 
  12 as a factor to divide the zodiac because 365 is quite a large number. But 
  here we shall use 27. Thus zodiac is divided into 27 divisions and each one 
  is called as a </font><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">Nakshatra 
  division</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">. A nakshatra is equal to 
  1/27<SUP>th</SUP> part of the zodiac, that is, each nakshatra division has a 
  width of 360</FONT><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">/27 
  = 13</FONT><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><font size="4" color="#000000">°</font></font><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">20'. 
  This means that the moon takes slightly more than a day, on the average, to 
  cover a nakshatra division. In fact, this is why the zodiac is divided into 
  27 nakshatra divisions. You are already familiar with the names of the 27 nakshatras. 
  The beginning point of the first nakshatra namely Aswini is the same as the 
  beginning point of the Mesha rasi. </FONT><A HREF="AllNaksha.htm"><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Click

Similarly, a </FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">lunar nakshatra</FONT><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"> tells you where the moon is situated at that moment. For example, at 6 a.m IST on January 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 1992, the solar nakshatra was Poorvashadha and the lunar nakshatra was Visakha. </font></P><P>
<FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">Thus we have lunar and solar systems based on the moon and the sun respectively to keep track of time. <B>Now we shall see how to bring correlation between these two systems</B>. Obviously they are not the same, as 12 solar months has 365~ days and 12 lunar months would make only 354~ days. If we define a lunar year to be made up of 12 lunar months always, </font><B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode" COLOR="#ff00ff">the lunar year will keep on lagging behind the solar year at the rate of 10.8893 days per year</font></B><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">.
