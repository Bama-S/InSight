<p> We have seen that a lunar year consists of 12 lunar months. It may so happen 
  that a lunar month is completely contained in a solar month or, a solar month 
  in a lunar month. Absurd!!! is it?? NO. Lets make sense out of it. But before 
  that we'll finish our definition. In the former, the lunar month is called Adhika 
  maasa and in the later, the lunar month is called Kshaya maasa. 
  Now, a lunar month ( 29. ... days) fitting into a solar month definitely 
  and obviously makes sense. At the same time it should not be forgotten that 
  the Sun doesn't revolve uniformly in its ecliptic. So some solar months have 
  less than 30 days (like Feb having 28 or 29 days). And so a lunar month completely 
  fitting into such a solar month, its once in a blue moon !!! //( Whats a blue 
  moon???) Actually it ( Kshaya maasa) occurs normally once in <b>141 years</b> 
  but occationally after a span of just 19 years ! In a lunar year with a Kshaya 
  maasa there will always be two Adhika maasas, one before and the other after 
  the Kshaya maasa. An Adhika maasa occurs after 33 months. Can you guess why? 
  <dfn>//due to the 10. ... days per year lag of the lunar year with respect to 
  the solar year//</dfn></p>

<p>Thats it, but if you want technical stuff continue reading...<br>
  Adhika maasa is a lunar month that occurs between two solar sankrantis. In other 
  words there are two amavasyas in one solar month. Such a lunar month is given 
  the name of solar month with two amavasyas. The next lunar month is assigned 
  a name in the sequencial order as thought there was no Adhika maasa. Beware, 
  Adhika maasas are generally considered<em><u> inauspicious</u></em> !<br>

it should not be forgotten that the Sun doesn't revolve uniformly in its

once in a blue moon! (ya, that is very rare). Normally, it (Kshaya maasa) occurs 
once in <b>141 years</b> but occasionally after a span of 
just 19 years! </FONT></p>

the solar month of Bhadrapada, there are two amavasyas. So an adhika maasa is 
introduced. This is given the same name as Bhadrapada. The Lunar month following 
this is a normal month and it is also called as Bhadrapada.</P><FONT
