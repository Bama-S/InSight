<p align="left"><font size="4">In the previous section, we studied the motion 
  of the sun with respect to the stars. There is one more prominent object in 
  the sky. Yes, we are talking about the moon. Let us now look at the motion of 
  the moon with respect to the stars.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">We learnt that the sun completes one revolution 
  along the ecliptic in 365 1/4 days. The moon also revolves around the earth. 
  What is the time taken by the moon to complete one revolution? It is 27.3217 
  days or 27 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Thus the time taken by the moon to complete one 
  revolution around the earth along the ecliptic in the easterly direction is 
  called the </font><font color="#FF0080"
size="4">sidereal period of revolution of the moon</font><font
size="4">. It is equal to 27.3217 days. You might wonder why this is also called 
  as &quot;sidereal period&quot;. It is called so because this is also related 
  to the stars. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">You know very well that a circle is divided into 
  360</font><sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font
size="4">. In one hour, the minute hand of the clock covers 360</font> <sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font
size="4">. In half an hour, it covers 180</font> <sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font
size="4"> and so on. The moon completes one full rotation in 27.3217 days. That 
  is, it covers 360</font><sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font size="4"> in 27.3217 days. 
  Hence in one day it covers (360/27.3217)</font><sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font
size="4"> or 13.17</font><sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font size=4> along the ecliptic 
  per day.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">On a similar basis, the sun moves by 1</font><sup><sup>o</sup></sup><font size="4"> 
  along the ecliptic per day. Thus, the <i><b>motion of the moon is 13 times faster 
  than that of the sun.</b></i> We can notice the motion of the moon even in 2-3 
  hours. Let a moon be near a particular star at 9 p.m. After a few hours the 
  moon would have moved eastward with respect to that star. </font></p>
