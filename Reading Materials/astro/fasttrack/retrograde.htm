<p align="left"><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Long ago, our forefathers 
  discovered that some planets move in a westward direction. Planets which move 
  in westward direction are said to have a</font><font color="#FF0080" size="4" face="MS Sans Serif"> 
  <i><b><font color="#000000">retrograde (backward) motion</font></b></i><font color="#000000">.</font></font><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif"> 
  And planets moving in eastward direction are said to have </font><font color="#000000" size="4" face="MS Sans Serif"><b><i>direct 
  motion.</i></b></font></p>
<font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif"> When the motion of the planet is direct, 
it is <b><i>'margi'</i></b> and when the motion is retrograde, it is<i><b> 'vakri'.</b></i>

<p></p>
<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">The retrograde motion of the planets have 
  puzzled astronomers for centuries. It is very difficult to understand if we 
  consider the geocentric theory. But when we consider that all the planets move 
  around the sun it is easy to explain this peculiar motion of the planets. Since 
  earth is also a planet, it is also assumed to move around the sun. </font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Suppose that a man observes a fixed star, 
  say Ashwini and measures the angle of inclination with a planet, say Saturn 
  (mind you, this fellow is very slow). Assume that the observer again measures 
  the angle between the star and Saturn in a few months (it would have hardly 
  moved by that time). If it so happens that this measured angle is smaller than 
  the previously measured angle, the planet observed would appear to have moved 
  in the westward direction with respect to the star. This apparent motion of 
  the planet in the opposite direction is called 'retrograde motion'. The retrograde 
  motion can be observed only at certain periods of time, which depends on the 
  planet being observed.</font></p>
<p></p>
<font face="MS Sans Serif">For example, the planet Mars had a retrograde or westward 
motion (from October 20th 1990 to January 1st 1991). Saturn had a retrograde motion 
from May 4th 1990 to September 23rd 1990.</font></font>
