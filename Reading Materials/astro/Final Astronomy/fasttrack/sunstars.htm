<marquee><font size=5><b>Sun's motion with respect to the Stars:</b></font></marquee> 
<FONT SIZE=4> 
<P>You would have very well noticed during the course of the day that the Sun 
  rises in the east and sets in the west. You must also be aware that this rising, 
  traversing the sky and setting of the Sun is actually due to the earth's rotation 
  about its axis with a periodicity of 24 hours. Since we are standing on the 
  earth and looking at the sun, we view the sun to be rotating around the earth 
  with a periodicity of 24 hours, though it is the reverse that is happening. 
  We have also seen in the previous sections, about the motion of stars around 
  the earth. This apparent motion of heavenly objects due to the rotation of the 
  earth is called the <B>diurnal path</B> of that object.</P>
<P>A question which follows is: Do the Sun and the stars move with the same speed? 
</P>
<P>No. They don't. The Sun moves at a slower rate than the stars. We will understand 
  the speed difference through an example. Suppose the Sun and some star, say 
  Kritthika, are close to each other at sunset. At the next sunset, the Sun would 
  have moved a bit from the star. This shift is very small for a single day and 
  may not be observable. But after a long time, say a month, the separation would 
  be significant. <a name="sunmotion"></a>This is because, the sun takes 24 hours 
  to revolve around the earth, while the stars take 23 hours 56 minutes &amp; 
  4 seconds to complete this rotation. We may think that there's not much of a 
  difference between the time taken by the sun &amp; the stars. But, it makes 
  a lot of difference.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>The time taken by the sun to complete one rotation (24 hours) is one "</font><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff"><STRONG>Mean solar day</strong></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>" or one "</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff"><STRONG>Civil day</strong></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>". The time taken by the stars to complete one rotation (23 hours, 56 minutes &amp; 4 seconds) is one "</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff"><STRONG>Sidereal day</strong></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>". Sidereal means something related to the stars. Note that there is a gap of nearly 4 minutes between these two days. </font></P>
<FONT SIZE=4> 
<P><a name="sunlag"></a>Suppose the sun is near a particular star on a particular 
  day. After one Sidereal day i.e.23 hours, 56 minutes &amp; 4 seconds, the stars 
  would have completed one full rotation. The Sun would be lagging behind by nearly 
  4 minutes.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>Let a star rise in the eastern horizon on a day at 9 p.m. After 30 days the same star will rise in the eastern horizon at 7 p.m. As we know there is a time lag of nearly 4 minutes per day. For a span of 30 days it becomes nearly 120 minutes or 2 hours.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose that Magha rises and sets with the sun on some day, say August 22nd. Hence on 22nd August the star Magha will be associated with the sun. Chitra will rise and set with the sun on October 18th. Therefore, on October 18th the star Chitra will be associated with the sun. </P>
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4>We know that the Sun moves in a path called the ecliptic, and this corresponds to the revolution of the earth around the Sun. The sun takes 365 days to complete one cycle, to be more accurate 365.25636 days. This is known as one "</font><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff"><STRONG>Solar year</strong></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>". </font></P><P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Each star comes back to its same position after every 366.25636 solar days. This is known as one "</font><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff00ff"><STRONG>Sidereal year</strong></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>". Let us understand this. </font></P><FONT SIZE=4>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>A solar year contains 365 1/4 days. For practical purposes it is very inconvenient to have a fraction of a day within a year. To avoid this, the following method is adopted. A normal year consists of 365 days. An extra day is added to every fourth year called a 'leap year'. When the year number is divisible by 4, then that year is a leap year. Hence 1991,1993,1994 are normal years consisting of 365 days, whereas 1992 is a leap year having 366 days. Hence the average is 365 1/4 days.</P>
