</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><BLOCKQUOTE>We've seen that the sun, the moon and stars appear to be revolving around the earth during the course of a single day and that this is actually due to rotation of the earth. Let's consolidate all the facts about the earth's rotation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Consider an observer watching the night sky. If we draw an imaginary line from the point of the observer to the pole star, the whole sky seems to be revolving about this line. In ancient days, people believed that Earth was stationary and that the celestial objects were revolving around it everyday. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we are in a moving train and observe the objects outside, it appears as if everything outside is moving in the opposite direction and that we are stationary. Is this true? No, because it is the train that is really moving and the relative movement makes us feel that the objects outside the train are moving.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Similarly, it is the Earth which is rotating and not the celestial objects in the sky. Interestingly, Aryabhatta, one of our Indian astronomers, also thought of the earth as a rotating object. He reasoned that, if we consider the earth to be rotating, the celestial objects would revolve around the Sun.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we draw a line from the South Pole to the North Pole (which passes through the center of the earth), and extend it further, this line will pass through the pole star. The earth rotates around this line from west to east, completing one full rotation in a day. As the earth rotates from west to east, all celestial objects seem to move from east to west for a person on the surface of the earth. The earth is rotating about its axis completing one full rotation in about a day. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><BLOCKQUOTE>If the sun is exactly overhead in a particular place ( O</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">1</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"> ), then, it is noontime at that place. This is half way between sunrise and sunset times for that place. For a place ( O</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR="#0000ff">2</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">) whose longitude is 15° west of this place, noon-time will occur 1 hour later. This is because it takes 24 hours to complete one full rotation, i.e 360°. Thus for 1 hour, it is 360 / 24 = 15°. Thus the earth would take 1 hour to rotate by 15°.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Similarly for a place O</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">2</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">' which is 15° east of O</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">1</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">, noontime would have occured one hour earlier.</BLOCKQUOTE>
