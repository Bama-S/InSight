<p><font color="#000000"> There can only be a few people who have not gazed 
  at the stars and pondered over the mysteries of the universe and man's place in it. Some people spend most of their lifetime studying  
various celestial objects. By the very act of looking at the sky we become involved 
  with astronomy. Astronomy tells a fascinating story, a tale made all the more enthralling 
  by the ease with which any one can participate in astronomical observations. In the following sections, we present a brief introduction to this intriguing subject.
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"> We start off with a brief history of Indian 
  astronomy and mention some of the great Indian astronomers. Then we highlight 
  the Indian perspective of astronomy as we proceed. We will also look 
  at the Indian Calendar and its uniqueness. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">There are two major aspects to Indian astronomy. One 
  is observation and the other is calculation. In the following sections, we'll focus more 
  on the observation part. From time immemorial, Man observed that heavenly 
  bodies like sun, moon, stars etc. don't remain stationary, but keep changing 
  their positions. This made him to think that all heavenly bodies move around 
  the earth and all his theories about the other heavenly bodies were based upon 
  this assumption. This concept of earth being the centre of the universe is called 
  Geocentric model of the universe. Indian astronomy is based on this. This method 
  is easy to understand since it is purely based on observation. After Copernicus, we know 
  that Sun is the centre of solar system and the earth revolves around this. (This is known as the heliocentric model). But it is interesting to note that, all the calculations and theories developed by the Indian astronomers using the geocentric model still hold good. We will take a look at these in detail as we go on.</font></p>
