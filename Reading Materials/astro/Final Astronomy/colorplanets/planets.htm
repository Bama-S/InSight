<FONT FACE="Calisto MT" SIZE=4><P>How do you identify a planet in the sky? A planet, like a star, is a small dot in the sky. But unlike a star, it doesn't twinkle. Some of the easily recognizable planets in the sky are Sukra (Venus), Mangala (Mars), Guru or Brihaspati (Jupiter), and Sani (Saturn). Others like Budha (Mercury) are more difficult to observe. Among the planets, Sukra is the brightest and hence easily observable. Over a period of time, the <I>planets move with reference to a star</I>. </P>
<P>Do you know why this happens? It is because the other planets, like the earth, revolve around the sun. Hence the position of a planet with respect to a star is changing. Among the observable planets, Sani is the slowest moving one. In fact the name Sani means slow in Sanskrit.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" SIZE=4>We know already that the period of revolution of earth is 365 days approximately. Similarly it varies widely from </font><FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>87.97 days</STRONG> </FONT><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" SIZE=4>for mercury to<STRONG> </strong></FONT><STRONG><FONT SIZE=4>247.7 years</FONT></STRONG> <FONT FACE="Calisto MT" SIZE=4>for Pluto. This difference is basically due to the distance of the planet from the sun. Mercury is very close to the sun - just 57.97 kms. So its period of revolution is less. But the distance of Pluto from sun is 5901.83 million kms so its period of revolution is 247.7 years. </font></P>
