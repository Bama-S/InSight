<BLOCKQUOTE>You must be knowing that sunrise occurs at different instants of time for different places. New York is lagging behind us (Chennai) by 11 hours. If it is 12 noon in Chennai, it is 1 a.m in New York.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 6th standard, your geography teacher told you that this is due to the spherical shape of the earth. She was right. But how is it so?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The earth has been divided into 24 zones (Because there are 24 hours in a day) depending upon the longitudes. Each time zone differs from one another by 1 hour. Each zone is 15° wide. The earth being a sphere comprises of 360°. (360° / 24 = 15°). The time zones have been named from 0 to 23. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All places between the longitudes 7 ½° west of Greenwich and 7 ½° east of Greenwich are in time zone 0. The time used in this zone is known as the Greenwich Mean Time or GMT.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If it is 12 noon at this time zone 0, that is referred to as 12 noon GMT.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A particular day starts exactly 12 hours before noon and ends 12 hours after noon. The suffix a.m is attached to times before noon and p.m to times after noon. For example, if the time is 7.12 a.m, that means 7 hours and 12 minutes have elapsed after the start of the day. If the time is 4.15 p.m., that means 4 hours and 15 minutes have elapsed after 12 noon. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><BLOCKQUOTE>The time zone +1 begins at the longitude 7 ½° east of Greenwich and extends to longitude 22 ½° east of Greenwich. We can proceed like this till we reach the time zone +12 which extends from 172 ½ ° east of Greenwich to 187 ½° east of Greenwich. Similarly, time zone -1 begins at longitude 7 ½° west of Greenwich and extends to longitude 22 ½° west of Greenwich. Similarly we can proceed upto time zone -12.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Did you realize that the time zones -12 and timezone +12 are one and the same?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The meridian corresponding to 180° east (which is the same as 180° west) is called the "International Dateline ". It is exactly in the middle of time zones +12 or time zone -12.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let the time be 3 p.m. GMT on March 12th. At the same instant, the time at time zone +1 is 4 p.m. (March 12th), the time at time zone +2 is 5 p.m. (March 12th), the time at time zone -1 is 2 p.m. (March 12th) etc. At time zone +10, the time is 1 a.m. on March 13th. The time zone +12 or the time zone -12 have same time but different dates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When one crosses the International dateline from west to east, we have to subtract one day in the western half to get the date in the eastern half. Similarly if one crosses the dateline from east to west, one has to add one day in the eastern half to get the date in the western half. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All parts of India lie in either the time zone +5 or the time zone +6. The standard meridian for India is taken to be 82 ½ ° east and Indian Standard Time (IST) is taken to be 5 ½ hours ahead of the GMT. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Local Mean Time (LMT) of a place is defined to be time measured with the local noontime taken as the reference. So when it is noon at a place, it is 12 noon LMT. Local midnight is 12 hours after local noon. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The longitudinal position of Ahmedabad is 72° 36' east. Hence Ahmedabad 9° 54 ' to the west of the standard meridean of India. This accounts to a time lag of 39 minutes, 36 minutes with respect to the IST. </BLOCKQUOTE>
