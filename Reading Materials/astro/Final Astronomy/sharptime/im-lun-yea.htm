<h2><i><font color="#CC00CC"face="lucida sans italic">Lunar systems</font></i></h2>
<p><font size=3 face="lucida sans italic">Tamil calenders are based on solar system. But Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam calenders are based on lunar system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .....Moon is very much nearer to earth when compared to sun. So, the time taken       
  by moon to revolve around earth is much less than the time taken y sun.S<font size="3">un 
  takes 365~ days to go around zodiac but moon takes just <b>27.32166 days</b>. 
  This time period is known as <font color="#FF0080"><b>sidereal period of moon</b></font>. 
  </font></font></p><font size=3 face="lucida sans italic">
<p><font size="3"face="lucida sans italic">Like rasi division in the solar system, here we have the <b>nakshatra 
  division</b>. You get nakshatra divisions by dividing zodiac into 27 divisions. 
  Thus, a nakshatra is equal to 1/27<sup>th</sup> part of the zodiac. Each nakshatra 
  division has a width of 360*/27 = 13*20&#146;. This means that the moon takes 
  slightly more than a day, on the average, to cover a nakshatra division.In fact, 
  this is why the zodiac is divided into 27 nakshatra divisions. You are already 
  familiar with the names of the 27 nakshatras. The beginning point of the first 
  nakshatra namely Aswini is the same as the beginning point of the Mesha rasi.<font color="#0000FF">

  the names of other nakshatras</a> </font></p>
<p><font size="3">A <u><font color="#800000">solar nakshtra</font></u> at a particular 
  moment is the nakshatra division in which the sun is situated at that moment. 
  Similarly, a <font color="#800000">lunar nakshatra</font> tells you where the 
  moon is situated at that moment. For example, at 6 a.m IST on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 
  1992, the solar nakshatra was Poorvashadha and the lunar nakshatra was Visakha.

<p><font size="3">Thus we have lunar and solar systems based on the moon and the 
  sun respectively to keep track of time. Now we shall see how to bring correlation 
  between these two systems.</font></p>
<p>If you take 12 sidereal periods of moon you get just 324 which is very much 
  less than 365. So you cannot have this sidereal period of moon as lunar month 
  because it will be very difficult to bring correlation between lunar and solar 
  systems. <font size="3">So we define a lunar month to be time interval at which 
  the sun and the moon osculate, i.e., <font color="#FF0080">lunar month</font> 
  = time period at which sun and moon meet periodically. One lunar month is equal 
  to <b>29.530588 days</b>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"> This period can be calculated as follows: </font>The moon takes 
  1.012 days (i.e.) 24 hours, 17 minutes and 9.4 seconds to cover a nakshatra. 
  The sun travels at nearly 0.99<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> per day along the ecliptic 
  whereas the moon travels at the rate of 13.17<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> per day. 
  Hence the moon overtakes the sun by 12.18<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> in one day 
  and in two days by 24.36<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> . After nearly 29 1/2 ( i.e., 
  360/12.18) days the sun and the moon would be in line as seen from the earth 
  and this results in <font
color="#FF0080">New moon day</font>. The sun and the moon are said to be <font color="#FF0080">in</font> 
  <font color="#FF0080">conjunction</font><font color="#0000FF">.To be more accurate 
  it takes 29 days,12 hours and 44 minutes, the new moon day repeats. This interval 
  is called the </font><font

<p><font size="3">And a <font color="#FF0080"><b>lunar year</b></font> is the 
  duration of 12 lunar months which equals <b>354.3670 days</b>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"> Obviously they are not same as 12 solar months has 365~ days 
  and 12 lunar months would make only 354~ days. If we define a lunar year to 
  be made up of 12 lunar months always, <font color="#800000"><b>the lunar year 
  will keep on lagging behind the solar year at the rate of 10.8893 days per year</b></font>. 
  Since lunar year is based on position of moon there will be no correlation between 
  the seasons and the lunar year. To avoid this, an additional month called <font color="#FF0080"><b>adhika 
  maasa</b></font> is added to a lunar year every now and then such that the average 
  duration of a lunar year is equal to an average solar year. As the lunar year 
  is being corrected to keep pace with the solar year, this system is known as 
  the luni-solar system. In the following we will discuss the relation between 
  the solar and lunar years and the procedure for introducing the <a href="Adhika%7E1.htm">Adhika
