<p><font size="4">The diurnal motion of any celestial object is the path traced 
  by the object in one day around the earth due to the rotation of the earth about 
  it's own axis. For the sun, it's </font><font size="4"> </font><font color="#FF0080" size="4"><b>diurnal</b><strong> 
  path</strong></font><font size="4"> on any day depends on the <u>declination 
  of the sun</u>. The following cycle of variation keeps repeating year after 
  year. The diurnal path keeps <strong>shifting to the North </strong>till the 
  summer solstice when the sun has maximum northerly declination of 23 1/2 degree 
  North. During this interval the days get longer and longer. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">From the summer solstice to the autumnal
equinox, the diurnal path reverses in direction and the Sun moves
closer and closer to the celestial equator. Between summer
solstice and autumnal equinox, the duration of the day <strong>keeps
on decreasing</strong>.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From autumnal equinox to winter solstice the
diurnal path keeps moving to the South. At the winter solstice
the sun has the maximum southerly declination of 23 1/2 degree
South. Between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice the
days continue to get shorter and shorter (less than 12 hours)
till the duration of the day is the least and this occurs at the
winter solstice.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">(If we repeat the other quarter cycle, we bet
you'll get bored. It is all very simple if you keep the diagram
in your mind.)</font></p>
