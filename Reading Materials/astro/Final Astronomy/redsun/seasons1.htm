    <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> The sun is not in a fixed position among 
      the stars. It is moving in an eastward direction (along the ecliptic) with 
      respect to the stars. Suppose that the axis of rotation of the earth is 
      exactly perpendicular to the plane of revolution of the sun amidst the stars, 
      as shown in figure below. Then, for any meridian, the duration of the day 
      and the night will be exactly 12 hours each always and there would be no 
      difference between one day and the other in the year. This is because, due 
      to the earth 's rotation, the sun will be in front of any particular point 
      on the earth for exactly 12 hours during which time it will be above the 
      horizon for that point. During the next 12 hours, that particular point 
      would not be facing the sun and it will be nighttime there. As there is 
      no difference between one day and the other, there will be no change of 
      seasons also throughout the year. This is contrary to our experience. We 
      know that the duration of the day varies throughout the year and the seasons 
      keep changing throughout the year, repeating themselves after one year how 
      can this be explained. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/38c.jpg" width="670" height="422"></p>
    <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The variation in the duration of daytime 
      and the occurrence of various seasons in the course of a year is due to 
      the tilt of the earth's axis from the perpendicular direction to the ecliptic. 
      The axis of the earth makes an angle of 23 ½° with the perpendicular to 
      the plane of the ecliptics .This angle (23 1/2°) is known as obliquity of 
      the ecliptic and is equal to the angle between the equatorial plane and 
      the plane of the ecliptic.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Now, consider the apparent motion of the 
      sun around the earth along the ecliptic in the figure below. When the sun is 
      at S2, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun's rays whereas 
      (fig below) the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun in this 
      position. So, the Northern Hemisphere receives more light and energy than 
      usual from the sun in this position, and it is summer time there. The Southern 
      Hemisphere receives less light and energy than usual from the sun in this 
      position and it is wintertime there. The situation gets reversed when the 
      sun is in position S4. In this position, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted 
      towards the sun and it is summer there whereas the Northern Hemisphere is 
      tilted away from the sun and it is winter there. When the sun is in positions 
      S1 and S3, neither hemisphere is particularly tilted towards or away from 
      the sun and the weather is comparatively mild in both the hemispheres. S3 
      corresponds to autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and spring in the Southern 
      Hemisphere, whereas S1 corresponds to the spring season in the north and 
      autumn in the south. The seasons and thereby the weather keep changing throughout 
      the year as the sun moves from S1 to S2 to S3 to S4 and back again to S1 
      The seasons clearly repeat themselves at intervals of one year.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> We have learnt that the sun makes a complete 
      revolution around the earth in the background of the stars in one year. 
      This is what a person on earth observes and is the geocentric picture of 
      the sun 's motion ( geo means something pertaining to the earth , and geo 
      centric is the viewpoint in which the earth is considered as the center). 
      However, careful observations of motions of planets indicate that it is 
      simpler to assume that it is the earth is moving around the sun as indeed 
      are other planets, in the background of stars, at a nearly uniform speed. 
      So, the earth is also a planet like mercury, Venus, Mars, etc. Different 
      planets take different times to complete one revolution, with the earth 
      taking one year. If somebody were observing the sun, the earth, the stars 
      and the planets from a point in space, at a large distance from the earth, 
      he would see the earth and the other planets circling around the sun at 
      different distances with different speeds. The sun and the stars will remain 
      stationary. This picture in which the sun is at the center and the earth 
      and other planets move around it is known as the heliocentric picture (helio 
      means something pertaining to the sun and heliocentric is the viewpoint 
      in which the sun is considered as the center). Does this mean that the geocentric 
      picture is wrong? No, it does not mean that. There is -nothing wrong in 
      either of the pictures. For any person stationed on the earth, the geocentric 
      picture is what actually corresponds to direct observations. The motion 
      of planets is much simpler to understand and more natural in the heliocentric 
      picture. The phenomenon of variations in day and night and seasons throughout 
      the year can be understood in the heliocentric picture as illustrated in 
      figure below</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The amount of sunlight received by any part 
      of the earth's surface (let us say, 1 square kilometer in area) depends 
      upon the angle made by the sun's rays with that part of the earth. At any 
      particular time, this will depend upon both the longitude and the latitude 
      of the place. This is illustrated in figure below for some meridian when 
      the sun is on that meridian (that is, it is noontime for that meridian). 
      It is seen that A receives sunlight directly, whereas if we move upward 
      towards B, C, D, and E those points receive the rays more and more slantingly. 
      The amount of sunlight received in one square kilometer of area keeps decreasing. 
      Similarly, the sunlight received in places east and west of this meridian 
      will also be less. The shaded area does not receive any light from the sun 
      and it is nighttime for that part of earth. The amount of sunlight of sunlight 
      received at a place depends both on the time of the day and the day of the 
      year, as the earth moves round the sun. If one takes the average over the 
      year, the region near the equator receives the maximum amount of sunlight 
      and this amount keeps decreasing as one moves towards the poles. The region 
      near the equator is warmer throughout the year compared to the northern 
      and southern latitudes. The regions near the poles are so cold that they 
      are permanently covered with ice. After learning all this, we should keep 
      one thing in mind. This gives only a general picture of the weather in different 
      parts of the globe, which is on the earth's surface. But do remember that the 
      weather at a place also depends upon the proximity to the sea, atmospheric conditions, presence 
      or absence of hills nearly, vegetation, and so on. With that we come to an end
      on the discussion on seasons. Now <a href="ecliptic.htm">back</a> to where we left.</font></p>
