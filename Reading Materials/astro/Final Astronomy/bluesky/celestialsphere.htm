  which we saw previously is so large that its size is as big as your mind
  can let you imagine. This is just one half of the total sphere and we can say that the other half is below us. This </font><font size="6">HUGE</font><font size="4"> sphere is what's called 
  the CELESTIAL SPHERE. You know that the earth is surrounded by various objects 
  like the sun, moon, stars, etc. These celestial objects are considered to be 
  situated on the surface of this sphere. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Our Mother Earth is more or less a sphere, somewhat similar 
  to the celestial sphere.</strong> You should have studied in your geography lessons 
  about the Earth's EQUATOR. This is an imaginary line constructed by the geographers 
  around the centre of the earth. It serves as a line of reference to explain 
  many geographic phenomena concerning the earth. Going by the same terms, the 
  astronomers also defined <strong>an imaginary line </strong> around the celestial 
  sphere. It may be considered as a 'logical extension' of the Earth's equator. 
  This line of reference is defined as the circle got by the intersection of the plane of the Earth's equator and the Celestial Sphere. This circle is what the astronomers 
  call as the <strong>CELESTIAL EQUATOR.</strong></font></p>
