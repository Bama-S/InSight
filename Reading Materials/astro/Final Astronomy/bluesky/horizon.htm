<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&nbsp; Everyone gets fascinated by the beauty and enormity of the night sky. Does the sky have any boundary? Or is it endless? If you watch it you'll feel that it meets the earth at a long distance in every direction. The points where the sky appears to meet the earth form a large circle. This circle, where the sky seems to meet the earth is called the <B><EM>horizon</em></B>. What is the shape of the sky you see? It looks like the inside of a dome or a hemisphere, which is covering the earth. If you imagine yourself to be on a vast plane surface, the circle where this plane meets the hemispherical dome is the horizon. This horizon puts a limit to what you can see. Only that portion of the sky, which is above the horizon, is visible to you.</font></P></BODY>
