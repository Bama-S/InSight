<P>POLE STAR</P>
</strong></font></I><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>Have you ever observed any particular star or a constellation on a clear night? If not, try to watch one over a period of time (say, about an hour).</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Canaith" COLOR="#ffffff"><STRONG><P>Do the stars remain stationary? </P>
</strong></FONT><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>You might have observed that any star moves <I>towards the western portion of the sky</I>. Does the star really move such a distance in a small time? A little thought would reveal that this displacement is due to the rotation of the earth.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ffffff">To understand this better, imagine yourself to be on the surface of a big ball in a room. The roof of the room has several bulbs at different points. If the ball rotates, a bulb will appear to be at different positions and at different distances. Similarly, even though the stars are stationary, they appear to move because of earth's rotation. Also, if you consider any two stars, even though their position in the sky changes, the distance between them and the direction of one from the other remains fixed.</font><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" COLOR="#ffffff"><BR>

When observed keenly, do all stars appear to move? There is one star, which doesn't appear to move. This star, which is a faint one, is called the <STRONG>Pole star or Dhruva Thara</STRONG>.</font></P><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" COLOR="#ffffff">
<P>Why does it remain stationary?</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ffffff"><P><A NAME="pstar"></A>Consider again, the same example of a big ball and a roof full of bulbs. When the ball is rotating, there are two points on the ball, which don't appear to rotate. The axis of rotation passes through these points. Consider a bulb in the roof, which is along this axis. For an observer on the ball, this bulb appears to be at the same distance and same direction even when the ball is rotating. The star corresponding to this bulb is the pole star. It is the only fixed star in the sky. In fact, all the other stars revolve, with the line joining the observer and the pole star as their axis.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" COLOR="#ffffff">Well, all was good and easy with the example. There is a light on the roof right along the axis of the ball which is called the pole star. But now, </font><A HREF="how.htm"><FONT FACE="Calisto MT">how would you locate a small star in the unending abode of the night sky?</FONT></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Calisto MT" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff"><P>After all, why is the Pole star given so much importance? Is it worth the time spent in locating it?</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>The Pole star proves to be a very useful astronomical tool. Since it is the only fixed star in the sky, we can use it as a reference point to find other stars. But it has one more important use. Ever since man started travelling by sea, the pole star was his only aid in finding directions. </P>
<P>Identify the pole star in the sky. The direction which you see is the northern direction. Once you get the northern direction right, you can immediately find the other directions. Thus using the Pole star as reference, you define all directions. This is a tool astronomers find very handy.</P>
