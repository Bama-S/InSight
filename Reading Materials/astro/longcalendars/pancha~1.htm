<P>Panchanga or the almanac is an important tool for keeping track of various 
  celestial objects. So far, we've seen some important units of time, like years, 
  months, etc. A Panchanga deals with these and many other units of time and relates 
  them with one another. Moreover, the position of various objects like the sun, 
  moon and the planets, the rising times of Sun and the Moon etc., are given in 
  a Panchanga. How are the positions of the heavenly bodies measured? </font><A HREF="celest~1.htm"><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>Click here to find out</FONT></A><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> .
The Panchangas are published at various places since some values 
  like the rising time of the Sun, etc., are place dependent. It is essential that 
  you have some knowledge in Indian Panchanga, because it is  something like a geometry 
  set for your geometric constructions.</P>
<P>The Panchanga for a given year will first give the name of the year and the number of years that have been completed starting from an 'epoch' (some suitable instant of time). The Indian Panchanga apart from giving statistical values also gives astrological information like auspicious moments, dates for religious festivals, etc.<BR>
  Now, what is the Panchanga made up of? Panchanga, as the name denotes, is made 
  up of 5(pancha) parts (angas). They are, <BR>
- Vaara (of course the weekday)<BR>
  - tithi (It is not 'day', mind you. )<BR>
- Karana (You better know whats a tithi first, because this is half a tithi)<BR>
- Nakshatra (The same old nakshatra)<BR>
- Yoga (Just read through to find out )</P>

<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><STRONG><H2>Vaara:</H2>
</strong></FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>You must be familiar with the term Vaara. Vaara is the day of the week. The 
  weekdays are Ravi (Sunday), Soma (Monday), Mangala (Tuesday), Budha (Wednesday), 
  Guru or Brihaspati (Thursday), Sukra (Friday), Sani (Saturday) named after Sun, 
  moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn respectively. According to our tradition, 
  these heavenly bodies are supposed to be the presiding deities on the days named 
  after them.</P>

<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><STRONG><H2>Tithi:</H2>
</strong></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>You might have heard this term used 
  by many priests. What indeed is a tithi? We've already defined a lunar month 
  as the time taken for the separation between the Sun and the Moon to increase 
  by 360º. <a name="tithi"></a>We define a tithi to be the time taken for the 
  separation between the Sun and the Moon to increase by 12º. This means that 
  a tithi is one-thirtieth of a Lunar month. So you can consider it as a Lunar 
  day. </font><A HREF="tithi.htm"><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>Let us 
  have a look at the names of the tithis</FONT></A><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>. 
  But the duration of each tithi may vary because of the non-uniform motion of 
  the Moon. The tithi corresponding to a particular Solar day is defined as that 
  tithi which is present at sunrise. It may so happen that a tithi starts after 
  a sunrise and ends before the next sunrise. So, that tithi will be skipped. 
  It is also possible that a tithi starts just before surise and ends just after 
  the next sunrise. So,<EM> in this case two days will have the same tithi! </em></font></P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>How to find the tithi corresponding to a particular day? For a given day, find out the celestial longitude of the Sun and the Moon. The difference between them will give you the angular separation between them. If you divide this difference by 12, you'll get the no. of tithis elapsed since Amavasya. Thus, </P>
</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>Number of tithis completed = (celestial 
  longitude of moon - celestial longitude of sun)/12 (with 360</font><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 
  added to celestial longitude of the moon to make it greater than that of the 
  sun).</font></P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>The current tithi is this quantity plus one.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>Let us consider an <B>example</B>: <I>On January 1,1992, at 5:30am IST, the longitude of the moon and the sun are 212</i></font><I><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 24' and 256</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 3' 13'' respectively. Find the tithi.<BR>
Longitude of the moon = 212</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 24'<BR>
Longitude of the sun = 256</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 3' 39''<BR>
Difference = ((212</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 24' + 360</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> ) - 256</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 3' 39'')/12</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> = 26</font></i></P><I><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>Therefore the current tithi is 26 + 1 = 27th tithi from Amavasya.</P>
</font></I><P><HR><p></P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><STRONG><H2>Karana:</H2>
</strong></FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4><P>Karana is half a tithi. So a lunar month will have 60 karanas. There are only 11 names available for the karanas-</P>
<P>- seven<i> <b>chara</b></i> (movable) karanas, viz., Bava, Baalava, Kaulava, 
  Taitila, Gara, Vanija and Vishti<BR>
  - four <b><i>sthira</i></b> (immovable) karanas, viz., Sakuni, Chatushpada, 
  Naaga and Kimstughna.</P>
<P>These karanas occur in a particular order every month. The first half of the 
  sukla paksha prathama (the first tithi of the Sukla paksha) is Kimstughna and 
  the second half is the bava. The next karanas are the chara karanas, namely, 
  baalava, kaulava etc. upto Vishti. These sets of seven Karanas repeat 8 times. 
  So we have covered 1 +(7*8)=57 karanas. The 58th karana, corresponding to the 
  29th tithi of the month, is named sakuni. The next karana is the chatuspada 
  (1st half of amavasya) and the last karana of any lunar month is the naaga.

<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><STRONG><H2>Nakshatra:</H2>
</strong></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>The nakshatra division occupied by the 
  moon at a particular day gives the nakshatra corresponding to that day. Recall 
  that a Nakshatra division is obtained by dividing the circle of Moon's revolution 
  by 13</font><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 
  20' (360/27), so that we get 27 Nakshatra divisions. The starting and the ending 
  moment of a nakshatra are given in the Panchangas. The number of nakshatras 
  elapsed can be calculated from the Nirayana longitude of the moon as follows,</font></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>The number of nakshatras that have elapsed = Nirayana longitude of the moon at that instant / 13</font><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 20'</font></P>
<P><HR><p></P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><STRONG><H2>Yoga:</H2>
</strong></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>Yoga is yet another term present in 
  Panchangas. The number of yogas completed at any time is calculated as the sum 
  of the Nirayana longitudes of the Sun and the moon. If this sum exceeds 360</font><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>, 
  then subtract 360</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>. 
  This value is divided by 13</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=4>°</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4> 
  20' (which is 1/27 th of a full revolution). The current yoga is given by adding 
  1 to the completed number of yogas. There are 27 yogas and they are:</font></P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>1.Viskumbha 2.Preeti 3.Aayusman 4.Sowbaghya 5.Sobhana 6.Atiganda 7.Sukarma 8.Dhruti 9.Sula 10.Ganda 11.Vriddhi 12.Dhruva 13.Vyaghatta 14.Harshana 15.Vajra 16.Siddhi 17.Vyatipatta 18.Variyan 19.Parigha 20.Siva 21.Siddha 22.Sadhya 23.Subha 24.Sukla 25.Brahma 26.Indra 27.Vadhriti </P>
</FONT><P><HR><p></P>
<FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>These values are there in the Panchanga because, it is very essential to have 
  an accurate knowlede of the longitude of the sun and the moon to determine the 
  beginning and ending moments of a solar month, lunar month, tithi, karana, nakshatra 
  and yoga. Looking at it the other way, knowing these values gives the position 
  of various celestial objects. Its enough for now to know that many such ingenious 
  and simple methods were evolved in Indian astronomy to calculate the longitudes 
  of the sun, the moon and the planets and that these procedures were improvised 
  from time to time.</P>
<P>Apart from all these values the Panchanga also contains <B><I>Lagnas</i></B><I> (alternative for time) and <B>Muhurtas</B></I>.<I> </I>Let us see what they are.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><H3>Lagna: (or the ascendant)</H3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4>
<P>We've seen about the twelve Rasis, which correspond to the division of the 
  Zodiac into 12 zones. Lagna is closely related to Rasis. At any instant of time, 
  the Lagna is given by the Rasi, which is just above the horizon. Let us make 
  it a bit clearer. In a particular day, suppose a particular star rises in the 
  eastern sky at 6:00. Find out the Zodiacal division or Rasi corresponding to 
  that star. The Lagna at that time, corresponds to the Rasi of that star. In the 
  panchangas, the beginning moment of each lagna (Mesha, Vrishabha,...) on any 
  particular day is given. The durations of the different lagnas are different 
  because of the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator. Again the instant 
  corresponding to the beginning of each lagna would be different for places with 
  different latitudes. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic"><H3>Muhurtha and Ghatika:</H3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="lucida sans italic" SIZE=4><P>Each solar day consists of 30 muhurtas or 60 ghatikas. So the duration of a muhurta comes to 48 minutes, and that of a Ghatika is 24 minutes. </P>
