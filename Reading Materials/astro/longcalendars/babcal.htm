<h3><strong>Babylonian calendar</strong></h3>

<p><fontsize=3 face="lucida sans italic" color="#ffffff"><strong>The Babylonians were pioneers in observational
astronomy. They realized the need for intercalary months (adhika
maasa) as far back as 1800 B.C. as indicated by a record of the
great Babylonian king and lawgiver Hammurabi. It is said that
the thirteenth month was proclaimed by royal order throughout the
empire on the advice of the priests. Earlier, the Babylonians
used 3 adhika maasas in 8 years.</strong></p>

<p><strong>8 tropical years = 8 x 365.2422 = 2921.938 days<br>
Number of lunar months = 8 x 12 + 3 = 99, which corresponds to
99 x 29.530589 = 2923.528 days.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So the discrepancy is small. </strong></p>
