<P>Overview:</P>
</STRONG>
<P><a name="othercal"></a>In most of the kingdoms that existed in the past, there 
  was considerable research going on in the field of astronomy. The priests in 
  those kingdoms, as you would have come across in History, were the chief astrological 
  advisors for the king. They were the ones who qualified some particular days 
  as auspicious days and some others as not. This was done taking into account 
  the planetary positions in the sky. The calendar system that every kingdom followed 
  had either the sun or the moon as time markers, ie., most of the kingdoms tacitly 
  shared the idea of a solar year or lunar year. Interestingly, most of the empires 
  used the recurrence of seasons to find out the duration of the year (which is 
  due to sun periodically moving in its ecliptic) and almost everybody came up 
  with the number 365.25 or alteast 365 days. Amazing isn't it! Let's see more 
  about the different calendar systems.. </P>
