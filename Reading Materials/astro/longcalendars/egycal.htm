<h2>Egyptian Calendars </h2>

<p><font size =3 face="tempus sans itc">Like other ancient civilizations, the early Egyptians had a
year of 360 days divided into 12 months, each of 30 days. From
the period of recurrence of the <b>Nile floods</b> which is
connected with the seasons, Egyptians realised early that the
seasonal year consisted approximately of 365 days. The Egyptians
maintained the old custom of keeping months of 30 days duration
and 12 months made a year. But five days were added to the year
at the end. These were not attached to any month. After long
periods of observations, Egyptians found that the correct length
of the year was not 365 days but nearly <b>365.25 days</b>. But
they did not reform the calendar to take into account the extra
1/4 days.</font></p>
