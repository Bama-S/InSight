<h2>Iranian Calendars</h2>

<p><font size="4" face="tempus sans itc">Iran at the time of tis great Emperor, Darius adopted the
Egyptian calendar but took into account the correction of the
defict of 1/4 days of a day in a year. They had all years of 365
days but used an intercalary month ( adhika maasa) of 30 days in
a cycle of 120 years. the Iranian calendar in its essential form
is still followed by the Parsees (in India), who are the
descendants of the Iranians who took shelter in India.</font> </p>
