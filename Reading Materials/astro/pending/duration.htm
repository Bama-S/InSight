    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">How does the duration of daytime 
      vary with latitude? At the equator the duration of daytime is always 12 
      hours (throughout the year). For the northern latitudes, the duration of 
      daytime on any particular day increases with latitude between March 21st 
      and September 23rd and decreases with latitude between September 23rd and 
      March 21st.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> In India, in the southernmost 
      parts, the variation of the duration of the day time as well as the temperature 
      variations are not much during the course of the year. When one goes north, 
      both these variations become more marked. Northern parts of India, like 
      Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are very cold 
      in winter (compared to the southern parts) and very hot during the summer. 
      . We note that the duration of the day time is nearly 12 hours on March 
      22nd and September 23rd The extra 7-8 minutes is due to two reasons; (i) 
      the sun is visible even before it actually rises above the horizon due to 
      some atmospheric effects. (ii) The angular size of the sun which is 16' 
      ; the sunrise and sunset times given relate to the appearance and disappearance 
      of the upper limb of the sun on the horizon, whereas the 12 hours duration 
      quoted relates to the center of the sun. For Madras, which is comparatively 
      near the equator, the variation in the daytime is the least whereas it is 
      the highest for Delhi, which has the northernmost latitude among these cities.

    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The equatorial plane cuts the 
      plane of the ecliptic at two points S1 and S3 as in figure above . The sun 
      is at S1 on March 21st of the year and at S3 on September 23rd. It takes 
      half a year to cover this half of the ecliptic. Between March 21st (S1) 
      and September 23rd (S3) the sun is above or north of the equator. Between 
      September 23rd (S3) and March 21st (S1) it is to the south of or below the 
      equator. The sun is at the maximum distance north of the equator when it 
      is at S2 (on June 21st, that is quarter of a year from March 21st) and is 
      at the maximum distance south of the equator when it is at S4 (on December 
      21st, that is quarter of a year from September 23rd). For all northern latitudes 
      the duration of the day has the least value (less than 12 hours) on December 
      21st and the maximum value (greater than 12 hours) on June 21st. The duration 
      of the day keeps increasing continuously between December 21st and June 
      21st and deeps decreasing continuously between June 21st and December 21st. 
      On March 21st and September 23rd of the year, the duration of the daytime 
      (when the sun is above the horizon) and the duration of the nighttime (When 
      the sun is below the horizon) are both equal to 12 hours throughout the 
      world. On these days, the sun is on the plane of the equator. Variation 
      in the durations of day and night from March 21st to September 23rd, that 
      is, for a period of six months; the sun is always above the horizon at the 
      North Pole. So, it is one continuous day extending to six months at the 
      North Pole. The sun will be circling from north to east to south to west 
      to north, parallel to the horizon and at different heights from it, at the 
      North Pole during this period. In fact, for ll. Latitudes above 60 ½° north, 
      there will be some days during the six months period from March 21st to 
      September 23rd when the sun will be continuously above the horizon. The 
      actual number of such days increases from 0 at 66 1/2° north to six months 
      (182 or such days) at the North Pole which has a latitude of 90° north. 
      In large parts of the Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark and 
      Finland) where the latitude is large, the sun will set 2 to 3 hours before 
      midnight and rise 2 to 3 hours after midnight (that is 2 a.m. - 3 p.m.) 
      During a part of this six-month period. Hence, Norway is called the Land 
      of the Midnight Line. From September 23rd to March 21st, that is, during 
      the next six months, the sun is always below the horizon at the North Pole. 
      So it is one continuous night stretching to six months there. For all latitudes 
      above 66 1/2° north, there will be continuously below the horizon, the actual 
      number of such days increasing from 0 at 66 1/2° north to six months at 
      the North Pole. For the Scandinavian countries mentioned above, the sun 
      will rise 2 to 3 hours before noon and set 2 to 3 hours after noon during 
      a part of this period. Winter will be quite severe in these regions. The 
      summer is not so hot as in the region near the equator, as the Sunrays are 
      always slanting in this part of the globe. Till now, we have discussed only 
      the Northern Hemisphere of the earth. Similar considerations hold for the 
      Southern Hemisphere. For latitudes south of the equator, the duration of 
      the day will continue to decrease from December 21st to June 21st and will 
      continue to increase from June 21st to December 21st.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> In figure below, the apparent 
      paths of the sun during the course of the year are drawn for different latitudes: 
      (a) north pole (O=90°), (b) some large latitude (say O = 70°), (c) smaller 
      value of the latitude (say O = 20°, a typical latitude in India) and (d) 
      equator (O = O°). P. Is the North Pole. P1 corresponds to the path on June 
      21st when the sun is at the maximum distance north of the equator. Then 
      onwards this distance keeps decreaseing. P2 is the path on some typical 
      days between June 21st and September 23rd and P3 the path on September 23rd 
      when the sun moves on the equator from now on the sun would move south of 
      the equator and P4 is the path on some typical day between September 23rd 
      and December 21st. P5 is the path on December 21st when the sun is at the 
      maximum position south of the equator. Between December 21st and June 21st, 
      the sun would move northwards from P5->P1.P3 is again the path on March 
      21st when the sun moves on the equator on any given day the path is always 
      a circle Daytime on any day corresponds to the portion of the sun's path 
      which is above the horizon. If more than one half of the circle lies above 
      the horizon it means that the duration of daytime is more than 12 hours. 
      If less than one half of the circle lies above the horizon, it means that 
      the duration of daytime is less than 12 hours. Note how the sun is above 
      the horizon throughout the period between March 21st and September 23rd 
      and below the horizon between September 23rd and March 21st at the North 
      Pole. At the equator, on any day in the year, the sun is above the horizon 
      for 12 hours.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> The durations of the day and 
      the night vary throughout the year. Have you ever wondered as to why the 
      days are long in summer and nights long in winter, This is due to the obliquity 
      of the ecliptic, that is the inclination of the equatorial plane to the 
      plane of the ecliptic.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="5" color="#0000FF"><i><b>Changes in the durations 
      of sunrise and sunset over the year</b></i></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Because of the tilt of the 
      earth's axis , the directions of sunrise and sunset also vary throughout 
      the year .The sun rises exactly at the east point and sets exactly at the 
      west point only twice a year , i.e on the 21st of March and on the 23rd 
      of September</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">During the six months from 
      March 21st to September 23rd , the sun rises north of east and sets north 
      of west . On june 21st , the sun will rise at the maximum angle towards 
      the north from the east and will set at the maximum angle towards the north 
      from the west. Similarly , the sun rises south of east and sets south of 
      west during the six month period from September 23rd to March 21st. Sunrise 
      at the maximum angle towards the south from east , will be on the December 
      21st and so will be the sunset from the west .</font></p>
