<h2><b>Celestial longitudes and latitudes:</b></h2>

<p>How to locate an object in the night sky? An object in the surface of spherical 
  object like earth can be located by specifying latitudes and longitudes. Similarly 
  for locating an object in the celestial sphere, we make use of celestial latitudes 
  and celestial longitudes. We saw that measurements have to be made with respect 
  to a standard. So to determine the position of celestial objects, a reference 
  latitude and a reference longitude have to be chosen just like their geographic 
  counterparts (i.e., equator and the longitude through Greenwich). Now, these 
  standards must be fixed with respect to the earth. So the possible choices for 
  celestial latitudes are<br>
  - the ecliptic <br>
  - the celestial equator </p>
<p>But even the celestial equator will change when the axis of earth's rotation 
  changes. So we take the ecliptic as the reference.</p>

<p> In the above figure, the poiny 'r' is the refernce point in the ecliptic, corresponding to 0<sup><sup>o</sup></sup>
longitude. The latitude of the point 'x' in the surface of the sphere is given
by the angular measure of the arc 'xy' and the logitude is given by the angular
measure of the arc 'ry'. Note that any point along the great circle passing through
the points 'y', 'x' and 'k' have the same longitude.
</p>
<p>Now we've to fix the starting point of celestial longitude. For fixing the 
  reference for celestial longitude any arbitrary point can be chosen. Two most 
  popular choices are the begining point of the<u><i> Mesha rashi</i></u> and 
  the <i><u>Vernal equinox</u></i><u>.</u> The systems of measurement resulting 
  from these two choices are the <font color="#FF0080"><b>Nirayana and Sayana 
  systems</b></font>. Nirayana comes from Nir(without) and ayana(motion) and Sayana 
  means 'with motion'. Due to precession of equinoxes, the position of vernal 
  equinox changes. Hence in the Sayana system, the starting point of celestial 
  longitude changes. Hence the name Sayana. Now why did they choose the Vernal 
  equinox in Sayana system when it is not a fixed point? This maybe because the 
  Vernal equinox corresponds to a point where the celestial equator intersects 
  the ecliptic. Similarly Nirayana is so named because the beginning point of 
  Mesha rashi is a fixed point in the ecliptic.<br>
</p>

<p>The longitudes measured in the Nirayana and Sayana systems are called Nirayana 
  longitude and Sayana longitude respectively. The Sayana longitude leads the 
  Nirayana longitude by a factor of<strong> <font color="#FF0080">Ayanamasa</font></strong>.</p>

<p>Sayana longitude = Nirayana longitude + Ayanamasa</p>

<p>Now lets take a look at the notation of the longitudes. A 8s 16<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> 04' will mean 
  that the Sun has moved over 8 rasis and is in the 9th rasi at a displacement 
  of 16<sup><sup>o</sup></sup> 04'.</p>
