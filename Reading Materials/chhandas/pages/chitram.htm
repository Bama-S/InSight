<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might have read about
alliteration (occurrence of same sound in two or more words in succession to produce a
musical effect) and onomatopoeia (usage of words so as to convey the mood). But what's
pictorial representation of verses? Sounds strange, doesn't it? Well, let's find out. In
Sanskrit, it is possible to compose&nbsp;a verse so that it follows a geometric pattern.
Such a pattern used to form the verse is called a 'bandham'. </font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="3">Look at the following figure. Can you make out what
it is ? </font></p>

'saraaghavaa' are common to both the halves of the verse. Similarly, the last 3 letters,
'paasanaa' are common to both halves. In between, we read the verse like this : the
letters within the ellipses are common to both halves, but those letters divided by the
line are not.The first half of the verse is constructed by the letters above the line and
those inside the ellipse, read alternately. Similarly, the lower half includes the letters
below the line and those inside the ellipses. This is somewhat similar to <strong>gomootrikaa
bandham</strong>. This kind of arrangement is called <strong><span
style="color: rgb(255,0,0)">shara bandham</span>.</strong> 'shara' in Sanskrit means
arrow, and since the pattern has the shape of an arrow head, it got this name.</font></p>

sahasram</strong>'( by Sri Vedaanta Deshika, an exponent of VaiShNava philosophy). This
work contains many more verses like these, and they are much more intricate in their
construction.</font></p>

the level of sophistication attained by our poets in the construction of poems a long time
