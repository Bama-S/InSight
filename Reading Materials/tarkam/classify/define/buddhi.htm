we saw that cognition could be divided into remembrance and apprehension.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Apprehension can be valid or invalid.
&nbsp; This apprehension is the basic grounding for inferencing. <br>
As seen earlier valid apprehension comes from</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><em>Perception</em> is apprehension by
contact of an organ with the object, i.e. what one hears, sees, feels,etc<br>
For example, when we touch fire, we <em>feel</em>&nbsp; its heat. </font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><em>Inferencing</em> is correlation of
what one knows or perceives.<br>
For example, when the mother hears her infant crying, she can <em>infer</em>&nbsp; that
baby is hungry or that it wants to sleep.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><em>Analytical knowledge</em> primarily
deals with reasoning the cause of events and their actions.&nbsp; It is inborn in every
life form.<br>
Primarily it is a tool or aid that helps in inferencing.<br>
We carry an umbrella when it is cloudy.&nbsp; We do this because we know that clouds cause
rain, and their presence indicate a possibility of rain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><em>Verbal testimony</em> is what one
hears from a reliable source (e.g. a teacher) and accepts without question.&nbsp; <br>
For example, when we hear that the number of stars in the sky are practically infinite, we
accept it without testing its validity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold" color="#800000" size="5">Cause and Effects</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Inferencing is analysing the causes and
effects of what one perceives, thereby leading to a conclusion.&nbsp; Whenever there is an
effect, there <em>should be</em> a cause and vice-versa.&nbsp; In fact it can be said
that, there exists an inherent relationship between the cause and the effect. Moreover
cause invariably <strong>precedes </strong>effect.<br>
The rotation of earth around its axis is the cause of day and night. (Right cause)<br>
But one shouldn't say, day&nbsp; and night is caused due to the revolution of sun around
the earth, as the cause is invalid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">During the discussion about various
causes and their effects, we'll take the example of the weaving of the cloth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Causes can be of 2 types: the <em>general</em>
or the <em>specific</em>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">That which is the cause of every effect
is called the <strong>general cause</strong>. It <br>
Time, space and destiny are general causes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">That cause which is the specific to an
effect is the <strong>particular cause</strong>.<br>
For example, yarn in the production of cloth is the special cause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Particular causes further can be divided
into:</font></p>

    cause</font><!--msimagelist--></td>
  </tr>
<!--msimagelist--></table>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Inherent cause or primal cause is the
one without which the effect is impossible.<br>
e.g. Yarn is the inherent cause of the cloth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Non-inherent cause is that, which is not
inherent to the effect but is inherent in the primal cause.<br>
e.g. The color of yarn is the non-inherent cause of the color of the cloth.&nbsp; It is
inherent in the yarn,&nbsp; but is non-inherent in the cloth.&nbsp; This color is the
cause of coloring in the yarn, but it only incidental to the color of the cloth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">The Instrumental cause is the device or
tool that caused the effect. It cannot independently cause an effect. It invariably
complements the above 2 causes.<br>
In the above example, the loom is the instrumental cause for the production of
cloth(effect).</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><strong>Special causes</strong> are
those without which the effect is impossible.&nbsp; They are the one and only cause of the
event.<br>
For example, when an arrow hits the bird, it brings about the death of the bird
instantaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the arrow is the special cause as it alone brings about
the death of the bird, by its own activity of striking the bird.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Before we get into inferencing it is
worthwhile discussing about <strong>perception</strong>.&nbsp; This is because it has been
defined as a special cause of knowledge among the different ways and means to
apprehension.</font></p>
