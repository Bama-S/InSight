<p><a name="Shadow"></a><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4"><b>1. Shadow:</b><br>
Absolute negation of light is only darkness and not shadow.&nbsp; So it is right to define
shadow as the region of reduced intensity of light (in comparison with its surroundings).
It is interesting to note that there is dependence of shadow on its object and a shadow if
present is always associated with an object (be it even fire, i.e., you can even get the
shadow of fire in the presence of a high power torch.).</font></p>
