in Refinement</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">A precise definition should be both
sufficient and complete ,i.e, it shouldn't cover something outside its domain nor should
it leave out uncovered something in its domain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Here are some examples to help you .
These examples are exclusively designed to illustrate the actual difficulties in
classifying and the methods to overcome them.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">1)<strong>Nectar</strong>:</font>

<dl>
  <dt><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">We can define Nectar as &quot;a sweet
    liquid&quot; but this leads to ativyapthi i.e., this definition covers all classes of
    sweet liquids and not nectar alone. (e.g. glucose, honey, ...). So, to complete it, we add
    its other characteristics like : <br>
    naturally produced by and found in flowers.</font></dt>
</dl>

<hr>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">2)<strong>Herbivore</strong>:</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Herbivore is an animal that which eats
grass only. But this gives rise to avyapthi because this doesn't cover all herbivorous
animals like human vegetarians.So,we can redefine it as :<br>
&quot;All organisms that feed on plant and plant products.&quot;<br>
But, this leads to ativyapthi because besides covering herbivores it also cover
omnivores.So,the right way to define is:<br>
&quot;Herbivores are those organisms that feed on plant and plant products only.&quot;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">3)<strong>Hair</strong>:<br>
<br>
&quot;Dead cells that are found on animal body.&quot; By now,you must have recognized that
this naturally leads to ativyapti as nails are also dead cells that are found on animal
body. So, let's refine : <br>
&quot; Hairs are those dead cells that are found on animal body, are flexible,fine
stranded and are coloured.&quot;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Well, all things must be in place
now.&nbsp; Here are some more self-explanatory examples.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">4) <strong>Indians</strong> are those
who live in India other than the immigrants.<br>
<br>
Avyapthi..... : Indians may also live in other parts of world.<br>
Redefinition.: Those who live in India other than the immigrants and those who were born
in India and have emigrated from India.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">5) <strong>BasketBall game</strong>:<br>
<br>
Game played with a ball between two teams, each trying to put the ball in the <br>
opposing team's target area.<br>
Ativyapthi: Covers football too.<br>
Redefinition: It is a game played&nbsp; with a large ball between two teams, each trying
to the ball into&nbsp; the opposition's net fixed on a high metal ring.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">6) <strong>Moon</strong>:<br>
<br>
Body that revolves around earth.<br>
Ativyapthi: Artificial satellites also revolves earth.<br>
Redefinition: Heavenly body that revolves around earth.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">You must now have been convinced that
classification is an incremental and iterative process.You have to build up on your
definitions step by step such that in each step you add a specific property to make the
definition complete.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Now that you have learnt classification
and the refinement of definitions it is important to know how these are used in
understanding and logical reasoning. Check it out in the next page. </font></p>
