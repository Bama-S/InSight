<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Now that we've completed
classifications and have done some examples in definition, you should be able to refine
these definitions using the classification hierarchy that you've learnt.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">When we try to refine
such definitions , first we describe the primary characteristics that it possesses. If
such characteristics are common to more than one object we may go in for a refined
definition.&nbsp; The reason for refining is that, at every level of definition, we may
narrow down to describe the object only, and nothing but the object . Thus a precise
definition should be both sufficient and complete ,i.e, it shouldn't cover something
outside&nbsp; its domain nor should it leave out uncovered something in its domain.&nbsp;
This gives rise to the concept of <em>Avyaapti</em>&nbsp; (leaving out that which should
be included) and <em>Ativyaapti</em> ( including that which should be left out).</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Lets put down the steps
involved in refining a definition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><em>Steps Involved:</em>
</font>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">First enumerate the
    trivial characteristics of the object under consideration.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Using these
    characteristics, give a basic definition.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">This definition would
    invariably cover a much wider set of unrelated objects or <br>
    may fail to cover even the set of related objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Identify those
    characteristics that distinguish the object from this set of unrelated objects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Also find out the
    commonality in the set of related objects that it earlier failed to cover.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Now refine the definition
    with the characteristics identified.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">As more adjectives are
    added the definition narrows down on the object or its group.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">If this definition isn't
    unique go back to step 4.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Now lets try to define a
rose:<br>
<br>
Step 1:<br>
Identify the trivial characteristics :<br>
</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FF0000">Smell of a rose.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Step 2:<br>
Define the rose:<br>
</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FF0000">Rose is made of
earth(i.e. it comes from earth).</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><br>
This justifies the presence of smell in it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Step 3:<br>
Identify the deficiency in the current definition:<br>
The above definition isn't sufficient to define a rose. All things that are made of earth
possess smell (ativyaapti).</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000">Step 4:<br>
Identify the distinguishing characteristics:<br>
</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FF0000">Rose is a flower
that has good smell.</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><br>
<br>
Step 5:<br>
So the definition can be refined as follows:<br>
</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FF0000">Rose is a flower
that is made of earth and possesses good smell.</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><br>
But this is still insufficient, as all flowers posses good smell (ativyaapti).<br>
<br>
Step 4:<br>
Identify the distinguishing characteristics:<br>
</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FF0000">Rose has a distinct
shape.</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#000000"><br>
<br>
Step 5:<br>
The final definition goes as follows:<br>
</font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FF0000">Rose is a flower
that is made of earth, possesses good smell, and is distinctly identified by its shape. </font></p>
