system followed in Tarka Shaastram</u></em></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">We now take a look at a
classification system used in the science of Nyaya-Shastra. What is unique and striking
about this system is that it attempts to classify <i>everything</i> - from the atom to the
universe - within a single grand scheme. It is the universality of this scheme that makes
it special. Sounds interesting! Well, let's take a look at it. We focus on the <i>vaisheshika</i>
school of thought.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">The Vaiseshika
system divides things into 7 broad categories or <em>padharthaas</em>. They are :</font> </font>

  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Substance</em></font></li>
  <li style="color: rgb(255,255,255)" type="disc"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Quality</em></font></li>

  <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Absence</em></font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Let us take a look at
each of them in turn.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Substance</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Substance is the matter
that things are made of.&nbsp; It immediately follows that most of the substances can be
perceived by one's senses. <br>
For example,<br>
<em>Light</em> can be seen, <em>Food</em> can be smelt and tasted, <em>Breeze</em> can be
felt,&nbsp; <em>Thunder</em>&nbsp; can be heard.<br>
Here light, food, breeze and thunder are substances.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Quality</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Quality is that which is
possessed by a substance.&nbsp; It helps one to distinguish one substance from another.
They define the characteristics of objects.&nbsp; <br>
It can be likened to the <strong><em>adjective</em></strong> in a sentence.<br>
For example, <br>
when we talk about <em>sweet</em>&nbsp; food, <i>hot</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;water, etc <br>
the words sweet and hot characterise the substances food and water.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Action</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Actions are those events
which are performed on or by the substances. They cannot occur in the absence of a
substance.<br>
For example, <br>
when a person <em>eats</em> &nbsp; food<em>, </em>the process of eating is referred to as
action.<br>
Similarly, a horse running, a child crying are all actions.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Generality</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Generality is that
property which is common to several objects.&nbsp; It resides in more than one substance
or rather a group of substances.&nbsp; It can be referred to as a group characteristic.<br>
For example, <br>
tail is common to almost all animal species.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Particularity</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Particularity is the
distinguishing feature of an substance.&nbsp; It constitutes the individuality of objects.
It lays an emphasis on the uniqueness of individual or a group of objects.<br>
For example,<br>
When we talk about groups, we say that <em>fins</em> are unique to fishes (as a group). <br>
When we consider substances individually, we say no two <em>snow flakes</em> are alike.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Inherence</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Inherence is that
inseparable relationship, which exists between the substance and its quality. One of these
cannot exist without the other.<br>
For example,<br>
smell is inherent in a rose.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Absence</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Absence is non-existence
of one or more of the above characteristics.&nbsp; It can be expressed using negative
prefixes like &nbsp; dis- , un- , in- , mis- ,etc.<br>
For example, <br>
<em>dis-proportion</em> refers to absence of proportion;<br>
darkness is absence of light.</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The 7 categories that
have been mentioned here are considered to be comprehensive. The fact that this is
all-encompassing is supported by rigorous arguments. However it is easier to understand
them using examples.</font></p>
