<p align="center"><font size="6">द्रव्यम्</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Copperplate Gothic Bold" color="#800000">Substance</font></p>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Substance is the matter that things are made of.&nbsp; It 
is referred to as <u>dravyam</u>&nbsp; in 
Sanskrit.</font></p>

<p><em><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">It forms the <strong>base</strong> for actions and qualities</font></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Actions and qualities cannot&nbsp; be present 
    separately. They should be to tied to an object.&nbsp; Dravya acts as the 
    base that holds and binds these qualities and actions. That is why we 
    say</font><ul>
    <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Quality <em>of a 
        substance</em> and</font>
    <li><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Action <em>by or on a 
        substance</em> </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">In other words dravya may be thought of as an object 
    that has <br>
  a set of <em>qualities</em> and a defined set of&nbsp; <em>actions</em>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">

<p>These can further be divided into 9 categories :</p>

<p>1. Earth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (prthvi पृथ्वी) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earth or 'prthvi', is defined as that which 
    inherently possesses smell. Apart from this it also has the properties 
    of&nbsp; color and touch.&nbsp; One or more of these properties may be 
    subdued or enhanced due to its interaction with other substances.<br>
  <strong><em>Earth</em></strong>&nbsp; in this context refers to every material 
    substance and <strong>not only</strong> the planet 
    earth<strong>.&nbsp; </strong>Thus, all planets come 
    under the category of earth.<br>
  For example, clay, mud, 
    body, food, plants are all made of earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Water&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (aapa आप )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Water is that which is cold to touch. It is also 
    identified by its distinct taste. It is referred to as 'aapa' in Sanskrit. 
    &nbsp; It can be seen and felt as well . Though we study water to be 
    tasteless and odorless,&nbsp; natural water is sweet to taste.&nbsp;<br>
  Pond, river, stream are examples of water 
bodies.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>3. Light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tejas तेजस् ) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Light or 'tejas' is that which is hot to touch. It 
    can be seen and felt as well.<br>
  Sources of light are 
    fire, stars, lightning etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4. Air&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vaayu वायु ) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vaayu in sanskrit refers to air. It is that which 
    can be felt but can't be seen.&nbsp; When we refer to air, we mean the air 
    in space and not restrict ourselves to the atmosphere. It consists of gases 
    in outer space as well.<br>
  For example, Wind, Breeze, 
    Storm, etc are forms of air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5. Space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (aakaasha आकाश )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Space or 'aakaasha' is that which has only the 
    property of sound. It is one,all pervading, and eternal. It is a universal 
    substance that holds every other substance.<br>
  Space is <u>one</u>.&nbsp; It is <u>all 
    pervading</u> as it is present everywhere. <br>
  It is <u>eternal</u> because space can neither be created nor be 
    destroyed.</p>

<div align="center"><center>

<table border="2" cellpadding="2" width="75%" style="FONT-FAMILY: Abadi MT Condensed Light; FONT-SIZE: 14pt" background="../../../images/backdrop/olaibk.jpg">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">&nbsp;We find that if the first 
            five substances are are seen in the reverse order&nbsp;(i.e 
            Space,Air,Fire,Water,Earth) subsequent substances carry over the 
            properties of the previous ones(Except for Sound).This has  
            a resemblance with the order specified in the
      <a href="creation/creation.htm">creation of universe.</a>

<p>Before we get into the next 4 definitions it is 
important to know what a <strong>substrate</strong> is. It 
is a base&nbsp; that holds other substances or qualities.</p>

<p>6 .Time (kaala काल )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time or 'kaala' gives one the the notion of past, 
    present and future.&nbsp; Usage of words like yesterday, today, tomorrow , 
    morning , evening ,etc have an element of time involved in it. History is 
    one effect of time.<br>
  Time is one, all-pervading and 
    eternal. It is a substrate for all the substances.<br>
  For example, year and age, are the outcome of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7. Direction (Dik दिक्)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Direction referred to as 'dik', helps one to 
    understand the orientation between objects.&nbsp; While time is relative, 
    directions are absolute.&nbsp; Directions are indicated using the position 
    of the sun. It is divided into 4 broad categories - North, South, East and 
    West. It is also a substrate for all substances.<br>
  Directions like North-east ,South-west are derived from these 4 major 
    diks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>8. Soul (Aatmaa आत्मा )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soul or 'aatmaa' is the substrate of knowledge.<br>
  Aatmaa can be divided into 2 categories:<ul>
    <li>The <em>Paramaatmaa 
        </em>or the supreme soul, that is one and eternal.<br>
      It can be understood as God.
    <li>The <em>Jeevaatmaa </em>or 
        the individual soul on the other had is that of humans, animals, etc. It 
        is many and resides differently in each living being.<br>
      It is all-pervading and eternal.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>9. Mind (Manas मनस्)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mind is the instrument for experiencing 
    emotions.&nbsp; The qualities of mind are happiness, sorrow, anger, 
    etc.&nbsp; It is linked to each soul and is innumerable. It is atomic 
    (indivisible) and eternal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="4">Of these, earth, air, light and water are sub-divided into 
3 other categories referred to as <a target="_parent" href="bodorgob.htm">shareeram, indriyam and vishayam</a>.</font></p>

<p>Now let us take a look at some <a href="example/exmdrv2.htm" target="_parent">examples</a> of 
classification based on the substance characteristics.</p>
