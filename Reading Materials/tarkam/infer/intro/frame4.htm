<p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Solve the following puzzles. They certainly
require some application of thought. Often we solve these kind of puzzles. However, we
wouldn't deeply get into the thought process that went on in our heads leading to the
solution. After dealing with inference, it would be a good exercise to solve the following
puzzles and to find the basic blocks ( hetu, saadhya, vyaapti and paksha) of inference we
make in each stage. Doing this, we spend some time thinking about our own thought process.
So, try these.</big></p>
<big>

<p>(Since the premises are given, the induction part of inference is not needed here. Only
deduction and some 'common sense' is needed ! ) </big></font></p>

  passengers with the same names aboard the flight. We know the following about them.</big> </font></p>

    he ever knew.</big> </font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>4. The passenger with the same name as the
    copilot lives in Chicago.</big> </font></p>
    <p><big><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face">5. The copilot and a passenger, a top
    mathematician play the same poker games.&nbsp; </font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Three persons are shown three red hats and two
  black hats. They are seated in chairs placed in single file and blindfolded. A hat is
  placed on each person's head, the remaining hats are hidden, and the blindfolds are
  removed. One at a time, each person is asked to guess the color of the hat on his own
  head. </big></font></p>
  <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>The person who sits in the third chair is asked
  first. He confesses that he does not know the color of his hat, even though he can see the
  hats on the heads of his two companions, the second person, who can see only the hat of
  the person in front of him, also admits that he cannot guess his color. The first person,
  who can see no hats at all, says that he knows the color of his hat, and he is indeed
  correct. What color is the first person's hat? (All the three are equally intelligent !)</big></font></p>

  <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>The natives of a remote section of Chicago are
  all members of either one of two tribes, <em>South-siders</em> or <em>North-siders</em>.
  To a non-Chicagoan, they look exactly alike. But the members of the <em>North-siders</em>
  tribe always tell the truth, and the members of the <em>South-siders</em> tribe always
  lie. To this section of Chicago came an explorer who met three natives.</big></font></p>
  <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>&quot;Of what tribe are you?&quot; the explorer
  asked the first native.</big></font></p>
  <p><big><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face">&quot;Rush and Division&quot;, replied the
  native. (The native actually says, &quot;I am <em>North-siders</em>&quot; or &quot;I am <em>South-siders</em>&quot;,
  but you cannot understand it. Only other natives understand.)</font></big></p>
  <p><big><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face">&quot;What did he say?&quot; asked the explorer
  to the second and third natives, both of whom spoke English.</font></big></p>
  <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>&quot;He says he is <em>North-siders</em>&quot;,
  said the second.</big><br>
  <big>&quot;He says he is <em>South-siders</em>&quot;, said the third.</big></font></p>
  <p><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face"><big>To what tribes did the second and third natives
  belong?</big></font></p>
