<p><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT"><big>We have seen that the major sources of valid
knowledge are perception (prathyaksham), inference (anumaanam), analogy (upamaanam), and
verbal testimony (shaabdam). Indian science has always been a humble approach of Man
towards the peaceful co-existence with nature. This reflects in their ordering of the
sources of knowledge too. Perception (prathyaksham) is the most natural of the three
sources of knowledge. After all, what can be more natural than what you observe directly
through your senses! So, the Indian logicians have placed prathyaksham above all the other
sources of knowledge. Inference, which is the effort to derive knowledge from the observed
facts, comes next only to pratyaksham in the framework of tarka shaastram. Knowledge from
examples (analogy) is the next valid source of knowledge. The repository of knowledge
accumulated over the ages (shaabdam or aagama) is placed next to the knowledge from
examples. In the following sections, we shall deal with Inference (anumaanam).</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT"><big>Let us begin with an example. A very common
example that is dealt in the tarka&nbsp;framework is as follows:</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT"><big>One observes smoke in a mountain. The
conclusion that one can make out of this observation is that the mountain is pervaded by
fire. This is a simple case of inference (anumaanam). We shall try to understand it
better. When we see smoke in the mountain, the following may come to our mind :</big></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- There is smoke in the mountain.</big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- Smoke is always pervaded by fire. We've
  seen this in case of hearth, kerosene stove etc. </big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- So, if there is smoke somewhere, there
  should also be fire there.</big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- Hence, there is fire in the mountain. </big></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT"><big>In this example, we see that </big></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- &quot;Fire&quot; is that which is to be
  proved. </big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- The reason for our conclusion of&nbsp; the
  presence of&nbsp; fire is &quot;smoke&quot;.</big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- There is an indisputable association
  between smoke and fire i.e, wherever there is smoke, there is fire.</big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>- Mountain is the current place where the
  above association exists.</big></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT">In the parlance of tarka shaastram, the thing
to be proved (fire) is called the saadhya (</font><font color="#400080" face="xdvng">s:aDy:</font><font
color="#400080" face="Bell MT">). The reason (smoke) is called the 'hetu' (</font><font
color="#400080" face="xdvng">hðt:Ø</font><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT">). The
association (between smoke and fire) is called vyaapti</font><font color="#400080"
face="xdvng">&nbsp; </font><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT"> (</font><font
color="#400080" face="xdvng">vy:aept:</font><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT">). The
place (mountain) where we suspect the presence of saadhya is called the paksha ( </font><font
color="#400080" face="xdvng">p:x:</font><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT">).</font></big></p>

<p><font color="#400080" face="Bell MT"><big>You can see that, any case of inference
similar to that discussed above, will contain the basic building blocks - paksha, saadhya,
hetu, and vyaapti. Just to recap, </big></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>1. Paksha - The subject or the receptacle on
  which we formulate our deductions. </big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>2. Hetu - Reason existing in the paksha</big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>3. Saadhya - The thing we are trying to
  prove.</big></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Bell MT"><big>4. Vyaapti - Vyaapti is the quality of
  Saadhya being certainly co-existent with hetu in the same subject. This forms the central
  part of inference.</big></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><big><br>
<font color="#400080">Inferential knowledge arises out of what is called as paraamarsha.
Paraamarsha is nothing but the knowledge of hetu existing in the paksha accompanied by
vyaapti (of saadhya). In our example of the mountain and smoke,&nbsp; the knowledge
&quot;this mountain has smoke&quot;, accompanied by the vyaapti of 'fire being co-existent
with smoke' is&nbsp; paraamarsha. The knowledge - the mountain has fire -&nbsp; that
results from paraamarsha is the inferential knowledge (anumiti).</font></big></font></p>
