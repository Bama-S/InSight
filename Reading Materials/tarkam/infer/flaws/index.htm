<p><font face="Tahoma">So far we've seen several cases, where the power of inference was
brought out. An important step in the process is stating&nbsp; the reason for our
inferential&nbsp; knowledge. For example, while proving the existence of fire in the
mountain, smoke was the reason. But the mere presence of smoke is not sufficient to prove
the existence of fire. We should also prove that the presence of smoke <strong><em>establishes</em></strong>
the presence of fire. As already stated, this relationship between the reason and the
thing to be proved is called Vyapthi. This Vyapthi is shown by citing the example of
hearth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">If, either the reason, or the Vyapthi is wrong, the whole process
will lead to an erroneous result. For example the argument</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma">'Today is a full-moon day, because it is bright'</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">will lead to an erroneous conclusion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">To avoid such erroneous conclusions, 'Tarka Shastra' has listed
several types of defective reasoning. What is the need for such a classification of
defects? Consider an argument between two persons. There must be a common meeting point
between these two people. They must agree upon a set of rules. If they don't, then one of
them can indulge in a meaningless talk, and insist that what he says is correct. To avoid
that, certain types of arguments are considered to be flawed.</font></p>
