<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The following reasonings are unestablished with respect to
Paksha</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Sea cat has four legs, because it is a cat, like the
terrestrial cat.'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Paksha is 'Sea cat'. But there is nothing called 'sea
cat'. Hence the Paksha is unestablished.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">'American Elephant has tusk, because it is an elephant, like
the Indian elephant'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">In the above argument, the Paksha is American elephant,
which doesn't exist. (By American elephant, we don't mean the elephants in American zoos,
which are brought from India or Africa)</font></p>
