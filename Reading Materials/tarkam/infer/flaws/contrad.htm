<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Fire is not hot, because it is a substance,
like water'.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The above argument tries to prove that fire is not hot, by
stating that, water, which is a substance like fire, is not hot. But hotness is an
inherent property of fire. This can be understood by direct perception, i.e., by touching
it. Thus the contradiction of the thing to be proved, is established by some other reason.
Such a reasoning is called contradicted reason.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">How does this differ from antithetical reasoning? In the
above argument, the contradiction is established by <em>direct perception</em>. In the
case of antithetical reasoning, we're merely stating that, we can give a counter
argument.To put it in a different way, the argument</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Sound is not eternal, because it is a
product, like a jar'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">also suffers from antithetical reasoning. But if you state
that 'Fire is hot', it doesn't suffer from contradicted reason. </font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The contradicted reason is a result of&nbsp; the basic
principle of Tarka Shastra regarding rules of gaining valid knowledge. Tarka Shastra
places direct perception and verbal testimony (aagama) above inferential knowledge. Thus
the fact that fire is hot, which is obtained by direct perception, is considered to be
more valid than the inferential knowledge.</font></p>
