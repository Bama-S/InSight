<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Let's look a few examples of uncommon examples:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">'An elephant is a mammal, because it has tusk'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Tusk is present in no other mammals. Nor is it present in
non-mammals. Thus the reason tusk, is&nbsp; present, neither in similar instances, nor in
contradictory instances. Hence this comes under uncommon straying.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Humans can create things, because they have the sixth
sense'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Do you think this is a valid argument? Though it may seem
so, it suffers from uncommon straying. Sixth sense is unique to humans (atleast, we
believe so). Hence the reason is&nbsp; present neither in similar instances (i.e. those
which can create things), nor in contradictory instances (i.e., those which can't create
things).</font></p>
