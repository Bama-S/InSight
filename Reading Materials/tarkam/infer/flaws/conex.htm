<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Bats lay eggs, because they are birds like crow'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">But by direct perception, we can observe that bats don't lay
eggs. Since direct perception is more important than inference, the above reasoning is
invalid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">'Penguins can fly, because they are birds like crow'</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Here again, we can observe, just by using direct perception,
&nbsp; that Penguins can't fly. Hence this is also a contradicted reason</font></p>
