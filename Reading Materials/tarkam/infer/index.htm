<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Have you ever thought of&nbsp;
what made man so different from other forms of&nbsp; life? What made him advance through
the ages,&nbsp;right from the stone age to the present modern age? What made him the
master of this world? If you think about it, you'll conclude that SCIENCE is the one which
made all the difference. </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>What is science? Why should it
be the sole property of mankind? </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>The very essence of any science
is the accurate comprehension of&nbsp; truth. For instance, medicine is a science that
tries to understand the truth about the human body, geography is a science that tries to
comprehend the true nature of earth, and so on. The truth that every science pursues is
not always obvious. For example, apples were falling from trees from time immemorial but
it took a Newton to dig the truth of Gravity out of it. This ability of extracting the
hidden essence from the observable facts is very precious. 'Inference'&nbsp; is
exactly&nbsp; that.&nbsp; It is the application of thought to the observable facts
resulting in deduction. It tries to identify the cause and&nbsp; brings out its
relationship with the effect (In the case of Newton and apples, Gravity was the cause and
'falling' was the effect). </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Inference&nbsp; is not very
uncommon too. In fact, the most common things that we do everyday involve inference
(though we are not aware of it). One can sight many examples for that. For instance, when
a mother hears the cry of a child, she infers that the child is hungry and feeds it.&nbsp;
When you hear the sound of anklets, you infer that a woman is passing by. When you feel
the smell of the soil, you infer that it has started drizzling. When the sun is at the
top, vertically over your head, you infer that the time is around 12.00 noon. One more
example for the process of inference is from school. You'll be familiar with 'salt
analysis'. In salt testing, you infer the presence of a salt after making observations of
the salt's color, form, chemical properties, etc... Detective stories too are&nbsp; good
examples of inference. The detective uses his or her skills of deduction to unfold a
complex plot and finally discovers the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>When 'Inference' is so common,
why make a special study of it? </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Firstly, an analytical study of
inference would strengthen a person's logical thought. Since a study of inference deals
with 'How' inference is made and what&nbsp; the 'Correct' and 'Wrong' ways of inference
are,&nbsp;one gets an insight into the process of inference. This helps in sharpening
one's logical thinking.</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Secondly, since every branch of
science involves inference, the knowledge gained by a systematic study of inference can be
applied to other fields too. This could result in gaining a different perspective of those
fields. </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>So, the study of inference is
worth the effort!!</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#534F6C" face="Baskerville Old Face"><big>Ancient Indian thinkers have
done a great deal of work in the study of inference (anumaanam) as a part of Tarka
Shaastram. We'll take a look at the basics of&nbsp; the Indian approach towards the study
of inference in the forthcoming sections.</big></font></p>
