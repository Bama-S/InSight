<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">Following are some examples for paraartha
anumaanam. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">1) &quot;It's going to rain because there
are dark clouds looming over.&quot; </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#0000A0">1. We anticipate rain in the
  city.(pratijnaa)<br>
  2. Because there are dark clouds. (hetu)<br>
  3. Wherever there are dark clouds there will be rain.(example is trivial )<br>
  4. Dark clouds over a place are invariably associated with future rain in that place.
  (upanaya)<br>
  5. Therefore we anticipate rain in the city. (nigamana)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">In the above example, we infer the
unperceived effect from a perceived cause i.e., we infer future rain from dark clouds in
the sky.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">2) &quot;It has rained because the water of
the river is swift, muddy and flooded.&quot;</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#0000A0">1. We guess there was rain
  in the village (pratijnaa).<br>
  2. Because we observe the swift, muddy, flooded water of a river (hetu).<br>
  3. Whenever swift muddy flooding is observed in a river there should have been rain.<br>
  4. Swift muddy flooding (which is invariably associated with past rain) is observed in the
  village (upanaya).<br>
  5. Therefore we guess there was rain in the village (nigamana).</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">In the above example, we infer the
unperceived cause from the perceived effect. Past rain is the unperceived cause and the
flooded&nbsp; river water is the perceived effect.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">3) &quot;Cows have cloven hoofs because they
have horns&quot;.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#0000A0">1. Cows have cloven hoofs.
  (pratijnaa)<br>
  2. Because they have horns. (hetu)<br>
  3. Animals that have horns, have cloven hoofs because of co-existence of horns and cloven
  hoofs. (e.g. goat)<br>
  4. Cows have horns which are invariably co-existent with cloven hoofs. (upanaya)<br>
  5. Therefore, cows have cloven hoofs. (nigamana)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">In the above example, unlike the first two,
there is no cause-effect relationship. The relationship between hetu and saadhya is mere
invariable co-existence.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">4) Many of you might have played the
well-known game &quot;MineSweeper&quot;. A lot of inference is involved in this game.
Consider a snapshot from the game, which looks something like:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" color="#800080"><strong><em>About the game:</em></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">You have a grid containing cells as shown.
Cells may or may not have a mine. If they don't have a mine, then they contain a number.
This number corresponds to the number of immediate surrounding cells with a mine. At the start of
the game all the cells are unrevealed.&nbsp; So, we don't know about any cell. Cells are revealed by clicking on them.
 If we click on a mine, the mine blasts and we lose. If the cell we click on is not a mine, 
it is revealed and shows out a number which corresponds to the no. of surrounding mines. The object of the game is to
 find all the mines on the playing field.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">Here, in the grid shown above,  we have
cells which aren't numbered and are blank. Assume that they are cells without any mines.  Other cells which are marked  
in the figure are :</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">M cells&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mine is present.<br>
Grey&nbsp; cells &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cell which is not revealed. <br>
Numbered cells&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number indicates the number of mines
around that cell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (Ranges from 1 to&nbsp; 8). The cell itself is free of mines.
<br>Blank cells &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cells without any mines.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here, for simplicity, let the columns be referred by numbers while the rows by alphabets. The
cells are then named by their corresponding row name and column name.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">Let us find the hidden mines in the above
board. It involves inference. We'll find the hidden mines and indicate the members of paraartha anumaanam
in the process. The last two members of the paraartha anumaanam viz., upanaya and nigamana are left out
since they are easily found given the first three members.</font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><em>Stage 1:-</em></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">1. Cell C2 or C3 should have a mine. (pratijnaa)<br>
2. Cell B2 is numbered 3. 6 cells surrounding B2 are revealed. Among them two cells ( B1,
C1) have mines. (hetu) <br>
3. A cell X is numbered n, and that cell has m cells surrounding it. Out of that m cells r
cells are revealed and have k mines in them (We know the exact position of the mines). Then among the remaining m-r cells surrounding
X, n-k cells have mine.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">(eg: If a cell is numbered 1 (n), and that
cell have 8 (m) cells surrounding it, out of which 3 (r) cells are revealed and have 1 (k)
mine in them, then among the remaining (8-3=5) cells, 0 cells have mine.) (udaaharana) </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF0000">Therefore, C2 or C3 have a
mine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#800080"><strong><em>Stage 2:</em></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">1.&nbsp; Cell&nbsp;&nbsp; C4&nbsp; is
&nbsp;&nbsp; free. (pratijnaa) <br>
2.&nbsp; Cell&nbsp;&nbsp; B3&nbsp; is numbered one. There are 8 cells surrounding it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Stage 1 : C2 or C3&nbsp; have a mine.(hetu)<br>
3.&nbsp; A cell X is numbered n, and that cell has m cells surrounding it. We also know
that k mines are present in any of&nbsp; the r cells around it (even if we are'nt aware of the exact position of the mines). Then, among the remaining
m-r cells surrounding X, n-k cells have mine.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">(eg.&nbsp; A cell is numbered 2. There are 8
cells surrounding it. Out of that we know that 1 mine&nbsp; is present in any of the 5
cells. Then, among the remaining (8-5 = 3)&nbsp; any one should have a mine.) (udaaharana)</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF0000">Thus, C4 is free.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">The rest of the process is very simple by
considering cell B4&nbsp; and marking the mines around it. Try putting down the final
inference as five members of reasoning.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">The final answer is :</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF0000">Cell C3 and C5 have a
mine each.</font></p>
