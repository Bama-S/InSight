<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>Nyaaya divides inference into
two forms. </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>1. Svaartha (inference for
oneself).</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>2. Paraartha (inference for
others).</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>The former is <em>a
psychological process</em> using which one infers for oneself. The latter is a reasoning
that has to be done in <em>language</em>, to convince others. It is a formal procedure
through which one puts forth one's process of reasoning in a cogent manner to
others.&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>Svaartha is the cause of one's
own inferential knowledge. Going back to the previous example of smoke and mountain,
having repeatedly seen the vyaapti of fire with smoke in the fireplace etc.,&nbsp; one
arrives at the universal generalization - 'wherever there is smoke there is fire'. Then,
when he goes near a mountain and sees smoke there, there dawns in him the knowledge that
the mountain has smoke pervaded by fire. As already mentioned, this is known as
paraamarsha. From paraamarsha, the knowledge, &quot;the mountain has fire in it&quot;
arises. This process is svaartha anumaanam i.e., inference for oneself.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>But, this isn't enough when one
has to convince others of his inference. So, he employs a sound&nbsp; reasoning called
paraartha anumaanam to make others understand the same. The five members of this reasoning
are:</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>1. Pratijnaa - States the
proposition which is to be proved.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>2. Hetu - States the reason for
the establishment of the proposition.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>3. Udaaharana - Gives the
vyaapti along with an example.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>4. Upanaya - Applies vyaapti to
the present case.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>5. Nigamana - Gives the
conclusion drawn from the preceding propositions. </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>Let us see what these five
members are in case of our example of mountain and smoke. </big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>1. This mountain&nbsp; has fire.
(pratijnaa)</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>2. Because it has smoke. (hetu)</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>3. Whatever has smoke has fire,
eg., hearth. (udaaharana)</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>4. This hill has smoke (which is
invariably associated with fire). (upanaya)</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>5. Therefore, this hill has
fire. (nigamana)</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#400040"><big>Inference, as we know generally,
is a deduction process but nyaaya has rightly regarded inference as a combination of two
inseparably related processes viz., deduction (the process of infering a particular
instance from a general rule) and induction (the process of infering the general rule from
particular instances).Why should it be so? Deduction starts with a universal major premise
and tries to prove a particular instance. Actually, the universal premise itself is the
result of&nbsp; induction based on repeatedly observed instances. Hence, nyaaya combines
both induction (for recognizing vyaapti) and deduction (for infering the thing to be
proved) into the process of inference.&nbsp; </big></font></p>
